# Patent Match Prediction

This repository showcases a comprehensive project focused on **Patent Match Prediction** using state-of-the-art information retrieval techniques and natural language processing (NLP). The project explores methods like **TF-IDF**, **Word2Vec**, **BM25**, and advanced machine learning algorithms to address various tasks in the domain of patent analysis.

## üìå Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a system that can efficiently and accurately match citing patents to cited patents. This includes identifying relevant paragraphs that justify citations and classifying the type of citation links. The project was structured into three distinct tasks, each addressing a specific problem.

---

## üéØ Key Goals
- **Accurately match citing patents** to their corresponding cited patents.
- Extract relevant paragraphs that provide justification for the citation.
- Classify the nature of citation links using machine learning models.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### **Task 1: Citation Matching**
- **Objective**: Given a citing patent, identify the most relevant cited patents.
- **Techniques Used**: TF-IDF and BM25 for vectorization and text similarity measurement.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Mean Average Precision (**MAP**) 
  - Recall at K

### **Task 2: Paragraph Matching**
- **Objective**: For a given citing and cited patent pair, identify specific paragraphs that justify the citation.
- **Techniques Used**: Word2Vec embeddings for semantic understanding and BM25 for paragraph-level relevance measurement.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Average Precision (**MAP**)

### **Task 3: Citation Classification**
- **Objective**: Classify the nature of the citation relationship between citing and cited patents (e.g., technical reference, background, innovation build-up).
- **Techniques Used**: XGBoostClassifier for citation type classification.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Balanced accuracy metrics.

## üìÅ Data Description
The dataset includes cleaned and preprocessed patent documents, comprising abstracts, claims, and full-text content. The following files are utilized in this project:

- `Citing_ID_List_Test.json`: A list of citing patent IDs for testing.
- `create_embeddings.py`: A Python script to generate word embeddings using Word2Vec.
- `starter_notebook.ipynb`: A starter Jupyter Notebook for the initial project setup.
- Project Notebooks:
  - `task1.ipynb`: Notebook for the citation matching task.
  - `task2.ipynb`: Notebook for the paragraph matching task.
  - `task3.ipynb`: Notebook for the citation classification task.
- `predictions/`: Folder containing output prediction files generated during model evaluation.
