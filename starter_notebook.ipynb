The present invention relates to a device for controlling the braking of a trailer. It is well known that in the case of a trailer towed by a tractor, the braking systems thereof are operationally connected in such a way that the braking of the tractor actuated by the operator also causes the braking of the towed trailer. The braking system of the trailer is then controlled by the braking system of the tractor in order to synchronize the braking forces acting on these. Therefore, when the operator actuates the tractor\\'s brake pedal, they intervene on the tractor\\'s wheels and, by means of a braking valve (called a brake-trailer valve), also on the trailer\\'s braking system. As is well known, today\\'s towing vehicles are connected to their trailer by means of a connecting device comprising a pair of male joints adapted to be inserted into a pair of relative female joints associated with the trailer. In particular, the female joints can be connected to a control line adapted to supply the trailer\\'s braking system, and to an additional line respectively, adapted to deactivate the emergency and/or parking brake of the trailer itself. Under emergency situations, the additional line must be properly connected to the tank of the towing vehicle so as to allow the activation of the emergency and/or parking brake of the trailer and, therefore, the braking of the same. Then there are valve means placed inside the relative joint which are adapted to connect, in case of detachment of the trailer from the towing vehicle, the additional line with the discharge line so that the fluid under pressure that keeps the emergency and/or parking brake deactivated or the type of a spring brake with hydraulic release (called SAHR), is discharged into the collection tank thus allowing the spring to expand and to activate the automatic and/or parking braking. Known connecting devices do however have some drawbacks. It may be necessary to move the trailer even after it has been disconnected from the towing vehicle. They do not allow the trailer to be moved once it is disconnected from its towing vehicle because, as described above, in this operating condition the emergency and/or parking brake is activated due to the connection of the --> additional line with the collection tank. Another drawback of the known type of devices is that they do not allow towing a trailer with an old generation towing vehicle, i.e. provided with only the control line connected to the service braking system. The main aim of the present invention is to devise a device for controlling the braking of a trailer which allows the trailer itself to be moved even when this is disconnected from its towing vehicle. Within this aim, one object of the present invention is to devise a device which allows preventing the emergency and/or parking brake of the trailer from being incorrectly deactivated even after connection to the towing vehicle. Another object of the present invention is to effectively signal to the user the status of the automatic and/or parking braking of the trailer. Yet another object is to devise a device for controlling the braking of a trailer which allows a trailer to be towed also by means of old generation towing vehicles, i.e. vehicles of the single-line type. Another object of the present invention is to devise a device for controlling the braking of a trailer which allows overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art in the context of a simple, rational, easy, effective to use and low-cost solution. The aforementioned objects are achieved by the present device for controlling the braking of a trailer according to claim 1. Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be more evident from the description of a preferred, but not exclusive, embodiment of a device for controlling the braking of a trailer, illustrated by way of a nonlimiting example in the accompanying tables of drawing in which:Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the braking system of a trailer comprising a device according to the invention, in a first embodiment;Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the braking system of a trailer comprising a device according to the invention, in a second embodiment;Figure 3 is a side elevation view of a device according to the invention with the spool in a braking position;Figure 4 is a section of the device of Figure 3 according to the track plane IV-IV; -->Figure 5 is a side elevation view of the device shown in Figure 3 with the spool in the movement position;Figure 6 is a section of the device of Figure 5 according to the track plane VI-VI. With particular reference to these illustrations, reference numeral 1 globally indicates a device for controlling the braking of a trailer. The device 1 comprises at least one control line 2, connectable to a source of a work fluid (e.g. oil) at a first pressure, one braking line 3 connectable to the service braking system 4 of the trailer and communicating with the control line 2, at least one additional line 5 connectable to a source of a work fluid at a second pressure, at least one emergency line 6 connectable to the additional line 5 and connectable to the emergency and/or parking brake 7 of the trailer and comprises at least one discharge line 8 of the work fluid communicating with a collection tank 9. The device 1 then comprises first valve means (not visible in detail in the figures) operable between a braking position, wherein the additional line 5 is isolated from the discharge line 8, and an emergency position, wherein the additional line 5 is communicating with the discharge line 8. In the braking position, therefore, the work fluid present in the additional line 5 can be sent to the emergency and/or parking brake 7 by means of the emergency line 6, while in the emergency position the work fluid present along the additional line 5 is discharged into the collection tank 9. (Here, by the term \"first valve means\" are meant those contained in the joint 15 and which allow the line 5 to be connected to the line 8 as a result of the detachment of the female joints from the male joints). More specifically, the emergency and/or parking brake 7 comprises an actuating rod 10 and a control cylinder 11, the piston 11a of which is mechanically connected to the rod itself and is movable between a braking position and a release position, where inside the cylinder 11 elastic means 12 are housed which are adapted to push the piston 11a towards the braking position. Inside the cylinder 11 is defined a chamber 11b, which counteracts the elastic means 12, --> which is fed by the fluid along the emergency line 6. The embodiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 differ in the manner in which the emergency and/or parking brake 7 is implemented. Appropriately, the emergency and/or parking brakes 7 also serve as service brakes 4 depending on the operating condition. In particular, in the first embodiment of Figure 1, the piston 11a operates directly on the rod 10 as a result of the thrust exerted by the elastic means 12 and inside it, a channel 30 of the flow of the work fluid is obtained which communicates with the braking line 3 and operates on the rod 10. Under normal operating conditions, i.e. with the female joints 14, 15 connected to the relative male joints, the pressurized fluid present along the control line 2 operates on the rod 10 adjusting the service braking of the trailer and, at the same time, the pressurized fluid coming from the additional line 5 enters the chamber 11b so as to compress the elastic means 12 (from which it follows that the piston 11a does not exert any force on the rod 10). In this operating condition, the brake in question serves as service brake 4. The instant when the female joints 14, 15 detach from their male joints, the pressure along the control lines 2 and braking lines 3 is reset to zero and, at the same time, the work fluid contained in the chamber 11b is discharged into the collection tank 9. It follows, therefore, that the elastic means 12 push the piston 11a towards the rod 10, causing the displacement thereof. In this operating condition, the brake in question serves as emergency and/or parking brake 7. In the second embodiment of Figure 2, the piston 11a is mechanically connected to the rod 10 by means of a relevant cable 13. More in detail, the cable 13 is associated with one containment element 11c of the rod 10, inside which there is a channel 30 communicating with the braking line 3 and acting on the rod itself. Also in this case, the rod 10 can be moved due to the effect of the pressure along the braking line 3, thus serving as service brake 4, or due to the effect of the displacement of the containment element 11c due to the pulling force exerted by the cable 13 thereon as a result of the displacement of the piston 11a following the emptying of the chamber 11b and the action of the elastic means 12. The containment element 11c therefore acts in an alternative --> way on the rod 10 at the pressure exerted by the work fluid present along the braking line 3, thus avoiding the sum of the effects. In the preferred embodiments shown in the figures, the device 1 comprises a first female joint 14, which is communicating with the control line 2 and is connectable to a first male joint (not shown in the figures) associated with the towing vehicle, and a second female joint 15 communicating with the additional line 5 and with the discharge line 8 and comprising the first valve means, where the second female joint 15 can be connected to a second male joint (not shown in the figures) associated with the towing vehicle. According to the invention, the device 1 comprises at least second valve means 17 positioned between the additional line 5 and the emergency line 6 and operable between a braking position, wherein they connect the emergency line 6 to the additional line 5, and a movement position, wherein they isolate the emergency line 6 from the additional line 5. Advantageously, the device 1 also comprises pumping means 18 connected to the collection tank 9 and operable to send the work fluid from the collection tank itself along the emergency line 6 with the second valve means 17 in the movement position. The pumping means 18 are preferably of the manual type. More in detail, the device 1 comprises at least one basic body 19 supporting the second valve means 17 and the pumping means 18. As shown in the figures, the collection tank 9 is directly associated with the basic body 19. Preferably, between the pumping means 18 and the emergency line 6, are positioned one-way third valve means 22 adapted to prevent the return flow of the work fluid from the emergency line 6 to the collection tank 9. In addition, between the pumping means 18 and the collection tank 9 are positioned fourth valve means 29 adapted to prevent the return flow of the fluid to the collection tank itself. More specifically, the pumping means 18 comprise at least one lever 18a which can be operated manually by an operator and is adapted to move a small cylinder 18b inserted smoothly and tightly into a seat 18c obtained in the basic --> body 19 and communicating, through a taking channel 20 along which the fourth valve means 29 are arranged, with the collection tank 9. The seat 18c is then communicating, through a sending channel 21, with the emergency line 6, where along the sending channel 21 the third valve means 22 are arranged. Advantageously, the second valve means 17 comprise at least one seat 23, defined on the basic body 19, communicating with the additional line 5 and the emergency line 6, both of which have at least one defined section inside the basic body itself, and comprise at least one spool 24 housed in a sliding manner inside the seat 23. The spool 24 is adapted to place the additional line 5 in communication with the emergency line 6 in the braking position, so that the pressurized fluid can be supplied by the towing vehicle in the chamber 11b through the second female joint 15 or can be discharged from the chamber 11b into the collection tank 9, and to isolate the additional line 5 from the emergency line 6 in the movement position, so that the work fluid taken from the collection tank 9 by means of the pumping means 18 can be sent to the emergency and/or parking brake 7 by means of the emergency line 6. Preferably, the spool 24 has at least a first section 24a having a first thrust area A1 and a second section 24b having a second thrust area A2, where the diameter of the first thrust area A1, identified in the figures with φ1, is larger than the diameter of the second thrust area A2, identified in the figures with φ2. With the spool 24 in the movement position, the first thrust area A1 is communicating with the additional line 5, while the second thrust area A2 is communicating with the additional line 5 and with the emergency line 6. This means that when the additional line 5 is under pressure, due to the connection to the towing vehicle, the spool 24 moves autonomously to the braking position due to the greater thrust area on which the pressurized fluid operates. In particular, with the spool 24 in the movement position, the emergency line 6 is only communicating with the diameter φ2 (and therefore with the second thrust area A2) and therefore does not generate forces on the spool 24, while the additional line 5 communicates on the one hand with the first diameter φ1 (and therefore with the first thrust area A1) and on the other hand with the second diameter φ2 (and therefore with the second thrust area A2). --> Appropriately, the additional line 5 and the emergency line 6 face the seat 23 by means of an additional port 5a and an emergency port 6a, respectively, where sealing means 25 are positioned between them. In other words, the sealing means 25 are positioned between the first section 24a and the second section 24b with the spool 24 in movement position. The first section 24a protrudes outside the basic body 19 when the spool 24 is in the braking position, while it is completely contained inside the basic body itself when the spool 24 is in the movement position. Advantageously, the device 1 comprises mechanical connecting means 26 of the second female joint 15 to the spool 24, which are adapted to move the spool itself towards the braking position as a result of the detachment of the female joints 14, 15 from the relative male joints. In particular, the connecting means 26 first bring the spool 24 to the braking position and, subsequently, release the female joints 14, 15 from the relative male joints. The connecting means 26 are, e.g., of the type of an inextensible cable. Preferably, the device 1 comprises signaling means 27 for signaling the position of the second valve means 17. In the preferred embodiments shown in the figures, the signaling means 27 comprise at least one signaling element 28 associated in a movable manner with the basic body 19 and adapted to operate in conjunction with the spool 24. More specifically, the signaling element 28 is movable between a first work position, wherein it engages with the spool 24, when the latter is in the braking position, and a second work position, wherein it is disengaged from the spool 24 when the latter is in the movement position. The signaling element 28 is adapted to move from the first work position to the second work position as a result of the displacement of the spool 24 from the braking position to the movement position. The signaling element 28 comprises a fastening element 28a which engages with the first section 24a of the spool 24 when the latter is in the braking position, while when the spool 24 moves to the movement position, as a result of the entry of the first section 24a into the basic body 19 the fastening element 28a disengages from the first section itself. --> The signaling element 28 is preferably hinged to the basic body 19 and, as a result of the displacement of the spool 24 from the braking position to the movement position, it moves from the first work position to the second work position due to its own weight. The operation of the device according to the invention is as follows. During towing operations, i.e. when the female joints 14, 15 are connected to the relevant male joints associated with the towing vehicle, the control line 2 sends the work fluid coming from the braking system of the towing vehicle to the braking line 3, so as to activate the service braking system 4 of the trailer, and the additional line 5 sends the work fluid to the emergency line 6 so as to keep the emergency and/or parking brake 7 deactivated by means of the compression of the relevant elastic means 12. In this operating condition, the first valve means are in the braking position, so the additional line 5 is isolated from the discharge line 8 and, therefore, from the collection tank 9. When the female joints 14, 15 are disconnected from the relevant male joints, the additional line 5 is placed in communication with the discharge line 8 by the first valve means, which move from the braking position to the emergency position. As a result of the connection of the additional line 5 to the discharge line 8, the work fluid present inside the chamber 11b of the emergency and/or parking brake 7, which keeps the relevant elastic means 12 compressed, is discharged inside the collection tank 9 allowing the emergency and/or parking brake 7 to activate. In these operating conditions, the second valve means 17, and more particularly the spool 24, are kept in the braking position and the signaling element 28 is in the first work position. When the trailer needs to be moved, the spool 24 is manually moved to the movement position, thus interrupting the connection between the additional line 5 and the emergency line 6. In this operating configuration, the operator can then operate the pumping means 18 by sending the work fluid contained in the collection tank 9 along the emergency line 6 and, through it, inside the emergency and/or parking brake 7 so as to deactivate it by compressing the --> relevant elastic means 12. As a result of the movement of the spool 24 to the movement position, the signaling element 28 moves to the second work position due to its own weight, thus indicating that the emergency and/or parking brake 7 is deactivated. In the event that, as a result of the connection of the female joints 14, 15 with the relevant male joints, the additional line 5 returns to the second work position so that, even if the operator forgets returning the spool 24 to the braking position, as a result of the different thrust area on which operate the work fluid present in the additional line 5 and the fluid present along the emergency line 6, the spool 24 moves autonomously to the braking position, thus connecting the additional line 5 to the emergency line 6. As a result of the connection of the female joints 14, 15 to the male joints, the first valve means are automatically brought back to the braking position and the additional line 5 is isolated from the discharge line 8. The operator then manually returns the signaling element 28 to the first work position. In the event of the towing vehicle being of the old generation type, i.e. provided with a single male joint adapted to connect to the first female joint 14 and, therefore, to the control line 2, once this connection has been made, the spool 24 is manually moved to the movement position and the work fluid is sent from the collection tank 9 to the emergency line 6 by means of the pumping means 18. This deactivates the emergency and/or parking brake 7 and allows the trailer to be towed. In the event of the towing vehicle being detached from the trailer, the cable 13 exerts a pulling force on the spool 24 and returns it to the braking position, so as to place the emergency line 6 in communication with the additional line 5 and so as to allow the work fluid which kept the elastic means 12 compressed to flow into the collection tank 9 thus causing the activation of the emergency and/or parking brake 7. It has in practice been found that the described invention achieves the intended objects and, in particular, it is underlined that the device to which the present invention relates allows, thanks to the presence of the second valve means and --> of the pumping means, moving the trailer, by deactivating the corresponding emergency and/or parking brake even when the trailer itself is detached from the relevant towing vehicle. The device for controlling the braking according to the present invention also allows avoiding that the emergency and/or parking brake can remain deactivated even after being connected to the towing vehicle, thanks to the fact that the spool has sections with different diameters. Furthermore, the device which the present invention relates to makes it possible to promptly inform the user if the second valve means are in the braking or movement position, thus informing about the operating conditions in good time. Last but not least, the device for controlling the braking according to the invention allows the correct towing of the trailer even with a single-line old generation towing vehicle.'},\n",

The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts. Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as \"elements\"). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a \"processing system\" that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware --> configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software.

Accordingly, in one or more example embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage, other magnetic storage devices, combinations of the aforementioned types of computer-readable media, or any other medium that can be used to store computer executable code in the form of instructions or data structures that can be accessed by a computer. FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network 100. The wireless communications system (also referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN)) includes base stations 102, UEs 104, and an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) 160. The base stations 102 may include macro cells (high power cellular base station) and/or small cells (low power cellular base station). The macro cells include base stations. The small cells include femtocells, picocells, and microcells. The base stations 102 (collectively referred to as Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (EUTRAN)) interface with the EPC 160 through backhaul links 132 (e.g., S1 interface). In addition to other functions, the base stations 102 may perform one or more of the following functions: transfer of user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection --> setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, radio access network (RAN) sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, and delivery of warning messages. The base stations 102 may communicate directly or indirectly (e.g., through the EPC 160) with each other over backhaul links 134 (e.g., X2 interface). The backhaul links 134 may be wired or wireless. The base stations 102 may wirelessly communicate with the UEs 104. Each of the base stations 102 may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area 110. There may be overlapping geographic coverage areas 110. For example, the small cell 102\\' may have a coverage area 110\\' that overlaps the coverage area 110 of one or more macro base stations 102. A network that includes both small cell and macro cells may be known as a heterogeneous network. A heterogeneous network may also include Home Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group known as a closed subscriber group (CSG). The communication links 120 between the base stations 102 and the UEs 104 may include uplink (UL) (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE 104 to a base station 102 and/or downlink (DL) (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station 102 to a UE 104. The communication links 120 may use multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, including spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and/or transmit diversity. The communication links may be through one or more carriers. The base stations 102 / UEs 104 may use spectrum up to Y MHz (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 100 MHz) bandwidth per carrier allocated in a carrier aggregation of up to a total of Yx MHz (x component carriers) used for transmission in each direction. The carriers may or may not be adjacent to each other. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to DL and UL (e.g., more or less carriers may be allocated for DL than for UL). The component carriers may include a primary component carrier and one or more secondary component carriers. A primary component carrier may be referred to as a primary cell (PCell) and a secondary component carrier may be referred to as a secondary cell (SCell). The wireless communications system may further include a Wi-Fi access point (AP) 150 in communication with Wi-Fi stations (STAs) 152 via communication links 154 in a 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum. When communicating in an --> unlicensed frequency spectrum, the STAs 152 / AP 150 may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) prior to communicating in order to determine whether the channel is available. The small cell 102\\' may operate in a licensed and/or an unlicensed frequency spectrum. When operating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the small cell 102\\' may employ NR and use the same 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum as used by the Wi-Fi AP 150. The small cell 102\\', employing NR in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, may boost coverage to and/or increase capacity of the access network. The gNodeB (gNB) 180 may operate in millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies and/or near mmW frequencies in communication with the UE 104. When the gNB 180 operates in mmW or near mmW frequencies, the gNB 180 may be referred to as an mmW base station. Extremely high frequency (EHF) is part of the RF in the electromagnetic spectrum. EHF has a range of 30 GHz to 300 GHz and a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 10 millimeters. Radio waves in the band may be referred to as a millimeter wave. Near mmW may extend down to a frequency of 3 GHz with a wavelength of 100 millimeters. The super high frequency (SHF) band extends between 3 GHz and 30 GHz, also referred to as centimeter wave. Communications using the mmW / near mmW radio frequency band has extremely high path loss and a short range. The mmW base station 180 may utilize beamforming 184 with the UE 104 to compensate for the extremely high path loss and short range. The EPC 160 may include a Mobility Management Entity (MME) 162, other MMEs 164, a Serving Gateway 166, a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) Gateway 168, a Broadcast Multicast Service Center (BM-SC) 170, and a Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway 172. The MME 162 may be in communication with a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) 174. The MME 162 is the control node that processes the signaling between the UEs 104 and the EPC 160. Generally, the MME 162 provides bearer and connection management. All user Internet protocol (IP) packets are transferred through the Serving Gateway 166, which itself is connected to the PDN Gateway 172. The PDN Gateway 172 provides UE IP address allocation as well as other functions. The PDN Gateway 172 and the BM-SC 170 are connected to the IP Services 176. The IP Services 176 may include the Internet, an intranet, an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a PS --> Streaming Service (PSS), and/or other IP services. The BM-SC 170 may provide functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery. The BM-SC 170 may serve as an entry point for content provider MBMS transmission, may be used to authorize and initiate MBMS Bearer Services within a public land mobile network (PLMN), and may be used to schedule MBMS transmissions. The MBMS Gateway 168 may be used to distribute MBMS traffic to the base stations 102 belonging to a Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) area broadcasting a particular service, and may be responsible for session management (start/stop) and for collecting eMBMS related charging information. The base station may also be referred to as a gNB, Node B, evolved Node B (eNB), an access point, a base transceiver station, a radio base station, a radio transceiver, a transceiver function, a basic service set (BSS), an extended service set (ESS), or some other suitable terminology. The base station 102 provides an access point to the EPC 160 for a UE 104. Examples of UEs 104 include a cellular phone, a smart phone, a session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, a laptop, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a satellite radio, a global positioning system, a multimedia device, a video device, a digital audio player (e.g., MP3 player), a camera, a game console, a tablet, a smart device, a wearable device, a vehicle, an electric meter, a gas pump, a toaster, or any other similar functioning device. Some of the UEs 104 may be referred to as IoT devices (e.g., parking meter, gas pump, toaster, vehicles, etc.). The UE 104 may also be referred to as a station, a mobile station, a subscriber station, a mobile unit, a subscriber unit, a wireless unit, a remote unit, a mobile device, a wireless device, a wireless communications device, a remote device, a mobile subscriber station, an access terminal, a mobile terminal, a wireless terminal, a remote terminal, a handset, a user agent, a mobile client, a client, or some other suitable terminology. Referring again to FIG. 1, in certain aspects, the base station 180 may be configured to process synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing at least some of the synchronization signals, and to transmit the processed synchronization signals (198). FIG. 2A is a diagram 200 illustrating an example of a DL frame structure. FIG. 2B is a diagram 230 illustrating an example of channels within the DL frame structure. FIG. 2C is a diagram 250 illustrating an example of an UL frame structure. FIG. 2D is a diagram 280 illustrating an example of channels within the --> UL frame structure. Other wireless communication technologies may have a different frame structure and/or different channels. A frame (10 ms) may be divided into 10 equally sized subframes. Each subframe may include two consecutive time slots. A resource grid may be used to represent the two time slots, each time slot including one or more time concurrent resource blocks (RBs) (also referred to as physical RBs (PRBs)). The resource grid is divided into multiple resource elements (REs). For a normal cyclic prefix, an RB contains 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain and 7 consecutive symbols (for DL, OFDM symbols; for UL, SC-FDMA symbols) in the time domain, for a total of 84 REs. For an extended cyclic prefix, an RB contains 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain and 6 consecutive symbols in the time domain, for a total of 72 REs. The number of bits carried by each RE depends on the modulation scheme. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, some of the REs carry DL reference (pilot) signals (DL-RS) for channel estimation at the UE. The DL-RS may include cell-specific reference signals (CRS) (also sometimes called common RS), UE-specific reference signals (UE-RS), and channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS). FIG. 2A illustrates CRS for antenna ports 0, 1, 2, and 3 (indicated as R0, R1, R2, and R3, respectively), UE-RS for antenna port 5 (indicated as R5), and CSI-RS for antenna port 15 (indicated as R). FIG. 2B illustrates an example of various channels within a DL subframe of a frame. The physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) is within symbol 0 of slot 0, and carries a control format indicator (CFI) that indicates whether the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) occupies 1, 2, or 3 symbols (FIG. 2B illustrates a PDCCH that occupies 3 symbols). The PDCCH carries downlink control information (DCI) within one or more control channel elements (CCEs), each CCE including nine RE groups (REGs), each REG including four consecutive REs in an OFDM symbol. A UE may be configured with a UE-specific enhanced PDCCH (ePDCCH) that also carries DCI. The ePDCCH may have 2, 4, or 8 RB pairs (FIG. 2B shows two RB pairs, each subset including one RB pair). The physical hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) (HARQ) indicator channel (PHICH) is also within symbol 0 of slot 0 and carries the HARQ indicator (HI) that indicates HARQ acknowledgement (ACK) / negative ACK (NACK) feedback based on the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The primary synchronization channel (PSCH) may be within symbol 6 of slot 0 within subframes 0 and 5 of a frame. The PSCH carries a primary synchronization signal (PSS) that is --> used by a UE to determine subframe/symbol timing and a physical layer identity. The secondary synchronization channel (SSCH) may be within symbol 5 of slot 0 within subframes 0 and 5 of a frame. The SSCH carries a secondary synchronization signal (SSS) that is used by a UE to determine a physical layer cell identity group number and radio frame timing. Based on the physical layer identity and the physical layer cell identity group number, the UE can determine a physical cell identifier (PCI). Based on the PCI, the UE can determine the locations of the aforementioned DL-RS. The physical broadcast channel (PBCH), which carries a master information block (MIB), may be logically grouped with the PSCH and SSCH to form a synchronization signal (SS) block. The MIB provides a number of RBs in the DL system bandwidth, a PHICH configuration, and a system frame number (SFN). The physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) carries user data, broadcast system information not transmitted through the PBCH such as system information blocks (SIBs), and paging messages. As illustrated in FIG. 2C, some of the REs carry demodulation reference signals (DM-RS) for channel estimation at the base station. The UE may additionally transmit sounding reference signals (SRS) in the last symbol of a subframe. The SRS may have a comb structure, and a UE may transmit SRS on one of the combs. The SRS may be used by a base station for channel quality estimation to enable frequency-dependent scheduling on the UL. FIG. 2D illustrates an example of various channels within an UL subframe of a frame. A physical random access channel (PRACH) may be within one or more subframes within a frame based on the PRACH configuration. The PRACH may include six consecutive RB pairs within a subframe. The PRACH allows the UE to perform initial system access and achieve UL synchronization. A physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) may be located on edges of the UL system bandwidth. The PUCCH carries uplink control information (UCI), such as scheduling requests, a channel quality indicator (CQI), a precoding matrix indicator (PMI), a rank indicator (RI), and HARQ ACK/NACK feedback. The PUSCH carries data, and may additionally be used to carry a buffer status report (BSR), a power headroom report (PHR), and/or UCI. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a base station 310 in communication with a UE 350 in an access network. In the DL, IP packets from the EPC 160 may be provided to a controller/processor 375. The controller/processor 375 implements layer 3 and layer 2 functionality. Layer 3 includes a radio resource control (RRC) layer, and layer 2 --> includes a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, and a medium access control (MAC) layer. The controller/processor 375 provides RRC layer functionality associated with broadcasting of system information (e.g., MIB, SIBs), RRC connection control (e.g., RRC connection paging, RRC connection establishment, RRC connection modification, and RRC connection release), inter radio access technology (RAT) mobility, and measurement configuration for UE measurement reporting; PDCP layer functionality associated with header compression / decompression, security (ciphering, deciphering, integrity protection, integrity verification), and handover support functions; RLC layer functionality associated with the transfer of upper layer packet data units (PDUs), error correction through ARQ, concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of RLC service data units (SDUs), re-segmentation of RLC data PDUs, and reordering of RLC data PDUs; and MAC layer functionality associated with mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC SDUs onto transport blocks (TBs), demultiplexing of MAC SDUs from TBs, scheduling information reporting, error correction through HARQ, priority handling, and logical channel prioritization. The transmit (TX) processor 316 and the receive (RX) processor 370 implement layer 1 functionality associated with various signal processing functions. Layer 1, which includes a physical (PHY) layer, may include error detection on the transport channels, forward error correction (FEC) coding/decoding of the transport channels, interleaving, rate matching, mapping onto physical channels, modulation/demodulation of physical channels, and MIMO antenna processing. The TX processor 316 handles mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM)). The coded and modulated symbols may then be split into parallel streams. Each stream may then be mapped to an OFDM subcarrier, multiplexed with a reference signal (e.g., pilot) in the time and/or frequency domain, and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams. Channel estimates from a channel estimator 374 may be used to determine the coding and modulation scheme, as well as for spatial processing. The channel estimate may be --> derived from a reference signal and/or channel condition feedback transmitted by the UE 350. Each spatial stream may then be provided to a different antenna 320 via a separate transmitter 318TX. Each transmitter 318TX may modulate an RF carrier with a respective spatial stream for transmission. At the UE 350, each receiver 354RX receives a signal through its respective antenna 352. Each receiver 354RX recovers information modulated onto an RF carrier and provides the information to the receive (RX) processor 356. The TX processor 368 and the RX processor 356 implement layer 1 functionality associated with various signal processing functions. The RX processor 356 may perform spatial processing on the information to recover any spatial streams destined for the UE 350. If multiple spatial streams are destined for the UE 350, they may be combined by the RX processor 356 into a single OFDM symbol stream. The RX processor 356 then converts the OFDM symbol stream from the time-domain to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The frequency domain signal comprises a separate OFDM symbol stream for each subcarrier of the OFDM signal. The symbols on each subcarrier, and the reference signal, are recovered and demodulated by determining the most likely signal constellation points transmitted by the base station 310. These soft decisions may be based on channel estimates computed by the channel estimator 358. The soft decisions are then decoded and deinterleaved to recover the data and control signals that were originally transmitted by the base station 310 on the physical channel. The data and control signals are then provided to the controller/processor 359, which implements layer 3 and layer 2 functionality. The controller/processor 359 can be associated with a memory 360 that stores program codes and data. The memory 360 may be referred to as a computer-readable medium. In the UL, the controller/processor 359 provides demultiplexing between transport and logical channels, packet reassembly, deciphering, header decompression, and control signal processing to recover IP packets from the EPC 160. The controller/processor 359 is also responsible for error detection using an ACK and/or NACK protocol to support HARQ operations. Similar to the functionality described in connection with the DL transmission by the base station 310, the controller/processor 359 provides RRC layer functionality associated with system information (e.g., MIB, SIBs) acquisition, RRC connections, and measurement reporting; PDCP layer functionality associated with header --> compression / decompression, and security (ciphering, deciphering, integrity protection, integrity verification); RLC layer functionality associated with the transfer of upper layer PDUs, error correction through ARQ, concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of RLC SDUs, re-segmentation of RLC data PDUs, and reordering of RLC data PDUs; and MAC layer functionality associated with mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC SDUs onto TBs, demultiplexing of MAC SDUs from TBs, scheduling information reporting, error correction through HARQ, priority handling, and logical channel prioritization. Channel estimates derived by a channel estimator 358 from a reference signal or feedback transmitted by the base station 310 may be used by the TX processor 368 to select the appropriate coding and modulation schemes, and to facilitate spatial processing. The spatial streams generated by the TX processor 368 may be provided to different antenna 352 via separate transmitters 354TX. Each transmitter 354TX may modulate an RF carrier with a respective spatial stream for transmission. The UL transmission is processed at the base station 310 in a manner similar to that described in connection with the receiver function at the UE 350. Each receiver 318RX receives a signal through its respective antenna 320. Each receiver 318RX recovers information modulated onto an RF carrier and provides the information to a RX processor 370. The controller/processor 375 can be associated with a memory 376 that stores program codes and data. The memory 376 may be referred to as a computer-readable medium. In the UL, the controller/processor 375 provides demultiplexing between transport and logical channels, packet reassembly, deciphering, header decompression, control signal processing to recover IP packets from the UE 350. IP packets from the controller/processor 375 may be provided to the EPC 160. The controller/processor 375 is also responsible for error detection using an ACK and/or NACK protocol to support HARQ operations. FIG. 4 is a diagram 400 illustrating a base station 402 in communication with a UE 404. Referring to FIG. 4, the base station 402 may transmit a beamformed signal to the UE 404 in one or more of the directions 402a, 402b, 402c, 402d, 402e, 402f, 402g, 402h. The UE 404 may receive the beamformed signal from the base station 402 in one or more receive directions 404a, 404b, 404c, 404d. The UE 404 --> may also transmit a beamformed signal to the base station 402 in one or more of the directions 404a-404d. The base station 402 may receive the beamformed signal from the UE 404 in one or more of the receive directions 402a-402h. The base station 402 / UE 404 may perform beam training to determine the best receive and transmit directions for each of the base station 402 / UE 404. The transmit and receive directions for the base station 402 may or may not be the same. The transmit and receive directions for the UE 404 may or may not be the same. In an aspect, referring to FIG. 4, when the UE 404 turns on, the UE 404 searches for a nearby NR network. The UE 404 discovers the base station 402, which belongs to an NR network. The base station 402 transmits a synchronization signal block (SS block) including the PSS, SSS, and the PBCH (including the MIB) periodically in different transmit directions 402a - 402h. The UE 404 receives the transmission 402e including the PSS, SSS, and PBCH. Based on the received SS block, the UE 404 synchronizes to the NR network and camps on a cell associated with the base station 402. Synchronization signaling in LTE generally takes place twice over a radio frame, over multiple subcarriers. FIG. 5 is an example diagram 500 illustrating synchronization channels over a radio frame. As shown in FIG. 5, the synchronization channels for synchronization signaling are allocated every five subframes, over six subcarriers. Synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal may be transmitted in the subframes corresponding to the synchronization channels. A base station may use beamforming to transmit signals in a particular direction. For example, in an mmW system that utilize a high carrier frequency (e.g., 28 GHz or higher), path loss may be high and there may be additional non-line-of-sight loss (e.g., diffraction, reflection, absorption, etc.). For example, the carrier frequency for mmW communication may be 10 times higher than a carrier frequency for other types of wireless communication. In such an example, the mmW system may experience a path loss that is approximately 20 dB higher than other types of wireless communication cases at lower frequencies. To mitigate the path loss and/or additional non-line-of-sight loss in mmW systems, a base station may perform transmissions in a directional manner, where the transmissions are beam-formed to steer the transmissions of the beams in different directions. --> If the carrier frequency for wireless communication is high, the wavelength is short, which may allow a higher number of antennas to be implemented within a given antenna array length than can be implemented when a lower carrier frequency is used. Therefore, in the mmW system (using a high carrier frequency), a higher number of antennas may be used in a base station and/or a UE. For example, the BS may have 128 or 256 antennas and the UE may have 8, 16 or 24 antennas. With the high number of antennas, a beam-forming technique may be used to digitally change the direction of the beam (e.g., transmit beam and/or receive beam) by applying different phases for different antennas. Because beam-forming in a mmW system may provide a narrow beam for increased gain, the base station may transmit the narrow beam in different directions using beam-forming to transmit the narrow beam in different directions. The base station may also transmit synchronization signals in different directions using beam-forming in a sweeping manner. If there are multiple antenna ports (multiple sets of antennas) in the base station, the base station may transmit multiple beams per symbol. For example, the base station may sweep in multiple directions using multiple antenna ports in a cell specific manner. Each antenna port may include a set of antennas. For example, an antenna port including a set of antennas (e.g., 64 antennas) may transmit one beam in one direction, and another antenna port including another set of antennas may transmit another beam in another direction. Thus, multiple antenna ports may transmit multiple beams, each in a different direction. FIG. 6A is an example diagram 600 illustrating a base station sweeping in multiple directions. The base station 602 in FIG. 6 has fourteen antenna ports, and thus is capable of transmitting fourteen beams (beam 1 - beam 14) in fourteen different directions (sweeping in fourteen different directions). FIG. 6B is an example diagram 650 illustrating resource usage for the base station of FIG. 6A. As illustrated in FIG. 6B, a synchronization signal such as a PSS may be transmitted in fourteen directions via fourteen different beams using fourteen different resources respectively (e.g., fourteen different symbols). The UE may receive the synchronization signal in one of the directions that corresponds to the position of the UE. Therefore, in an aspect, the synchronization signal may not be frequency-division multiplexed with data signals. On the other hand, different synchronization signals such as a PSS, a SSS, an extended synchronization Signal (ESS), a PBCH signal, and a beam reference --> signal (BRS) may be frequency-division multiplexed with each other (e.g., by the base station), and may be transmitted in each of different directions of the beam-forming within each symbol. For example, for each direction, the synchronization signals may be frequency-division multiplexed with each other, but the synchronization signals in one direction may not be frequency-division multiplexed with synchronization signals in another direction. FIG. 7 is an example diagram 700 illustrating a synchronization subframe structure for a millimeter wave communication system. The synchronization subframe may be divided into 14 symbols, from symbol 0 to symbol 13. Within each symbol, 100 subcarriers may be communicated, where the first 41 RBs are used to carry BRSs and PBCHs, the next 18 RBs are used to carry an SSS, a PSS, and an ESS, and the next 41 RBs are used to carry BRSs and PBCHs. If different synchronization signals (for different synchronization channels) are frequency-division multiplexed with each other, peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) advantage may be lost. For example, if a base station transmits one type of synchronization signal (e.g., via a Zadoff Chu sequence), a base station may transmit at high power (e.g., with PAPR advantage). However, if multiple different types of synchronization signals (e.g., an SSS, a PSS, an ESS, a BRS, and a PBCH within one symbol (e.g., within one SS block), as shown in FIG. 7) are transmitted simultaneously within one symbol, the PAPR becomes high and thus the PAPR advantage may be lost. Thus, frequency-division multiplexing synchronization signals with each other within each symbol may not be desirable in terms of a PAPR advantage. On the other hand, if different synchronization signals are time-division multiplexed with each other, some PAPR advantage may be gained. This PAPR advantage may be particularly evident in channels carrying a PSS and an SSS channels. For example, a Zadoff Chu sequence used in the time-division multiplex of the synchronization signals may provide a PAPR advantage. Further, the PAPR advantage may be maintained if the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals are not frequency-division multiplexed with other signals. Thus, time-division multiplexing some of the synchronization signals may be desirable. --> According to an aspect of the disclosure, a base station processes synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing at least some of the synchronization signals (e.g., two or more synchronization signals), and then sends the processed synchronization signals to the UE. The base station may avoid frequency-division multiplexing at least some of the synchronization signals. In one example, the synchronization signals may be categorized into first synchronization signals including a PSS and an SSS, and second synchronization signals including an ESS, a BRS, and a PBCH signal. In another example, the first synchronization signals may include a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH, and the second synchronization signals may include a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH. In such examples, the base station may process the synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing at least one synchronization signal from the first synchronization signals and at least one synchronization signal from the second synchronization signals. In this example, the base station may process the first synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing or frequency-division multiplexing the synchronization signals within the first synchronization signals, and may process the second synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing or frequency-division multiplexing the synchronization signals within the second synchronization signals. Subsequently, the base station may time-division multiplex the processed first synchronization signals and the processed second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the base station may avoid frequency-division multiplexing the processed first synchronization signals and the processed second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the base station may avoid frequency-division multiplexing any synchronization signal from the first synchronization signals and any synchronization signal from the second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the base station may avoid frequency-division multiplexing the synchronization signal(s) and data channel signal(s). In an aspect, the data channel signals may include ..PDSCH signals and/or PUSCH signals. After processing the synchronization signals, the base station transmits the processed synchronization signals to the UE, such that the UE may demultiplex the processed synchronization signals for synchronization with the base station. For example, the UE may demultiplex the processed synchronization signals by time-division demultiplexing at least one synchronization signal from the first --> synchronization signals and at least one synchronization signal from the second synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may demultiplex (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) first multiplexed synchronization signals that were multiplexed (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) within the first synchronization signals and demultiplex (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) second multiplexed synchronization signals that were multiplexed (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) within the second synchronization signals to produce a resulting synchronization signal, and may subsequently perform time-division demultiplex the resulting synchronization signals. In one example, the UE may perform by time-division demultiplexing of first multiplexed synchronization signals that were time-division multiplexed within the first synchronization signals and may perform time-division demultiplexing of second multiplexed synchronization signals that were time-division multiplexed within the second synchronization signals to produce a resulting synchronization signal, and may subsequently perform time-division demultiplexing of the resulting synchronization signals. In another example, the UE may perform by frequency-division demultiplexing of first multiplexed synchronization signals that were frequency-division multiplexed within the first synchronization signals and may perform frequency-division demultiplexing of second multiplexed synchronization signals that were frequency-division multiplexed within the second synchronization signals to produce a resulting synchronization signal, and may subsequently perform time-division demultiplexing of the resulting synchronization signals. In another example, the UE may perform time-division demultiplexing of first multiplexed synchronization signals that were time-division multiplexed within the first synchronization signals and may perform frequency-division demultiplexing of second multiplexed synchronization signals that were frequency-division multiplexed within the second synchronization signals to produce a resulting synchronization signal, and may subsequently perform time-division demultiplexing of the resulting synchronization signals In an aspect, the base station may transmit (e.g., to the UE) the synchronization signals in a synchronization signal block (SS block), where each SS block corresponds to a respective direction of a beam of the base station. When the base station transmits one or more burst sets, each burst set may include a set of SS --> blocks, where each SS block in the set of SS blocks may correspond to a respective beam direction. For example, in a scenario where a base station may sweep in 16 directions using 16 beams respectively, a burst set may contain 16 SS blocks, where each SS block corresponds to a different direction of a corresponding beam. A PSS or an SSS may be used to convey an SS block index within a burst set. For example, in mmW communication, for every beam direction, the base station may transmit a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH. In one example, a combination of the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH may constitute one SS block. In such an example, a burst set may include 16 SS blocks (e.g., in 16 directions) or 32 SS blocks (e.g., in 32 directions). In an aspect, a synchronization channel subframe (e.g., synchronization subframe) may include a processed synchronization signal including a set of synchronization signals (e.g., a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal) that have been processed and one or more repetitions of the processed synchronization signal. In an aspect, in a case where the processed synchronization signal is repeated one or more times, a synchronization channel subframe may also include a synchronization signal that is not repeated. The non-repeated synchronization signal may indicate time and/or frequency locations of repeated synchronization signals (e.g., time and/or frequency locations of a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal). The non-repeated synchronization signal may be an ESS. In an aspect, the processed synchronization signal may include a set of synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal. One or more of the synchronization signals may be repeated within the processed synchronization signal. In one example, the processed synchronization signal may include a PSS, an SSS, a repeated SSS, and a PBCH signal. In one example, the processed synchronization signal may include a PSS, an SSS, a PBCH signal and a repeated PBCH signal. In one example, the processed synchronization signal may include a PSS, an SSS, a DMRS for a PBCH signal and a repeated DMRS. In one aspect, in the processed synchronization signal, a synchronization signal and the repetition of the synchronization signal may be adjacent to each other in time. In another aspect, in the processed synchronization signal, a synchronization signal and the repetition of the synchronization signal may be separated from each other in time. Repetition of the synchronization signal within a processed synchronization signal may provide additional benefits in that the --> synchronization signal and the repetition of the synchronization allow frequency error estimation based on the synchronization signal and the repetition of the synchronization (e.g., by estimating a carrier frequency offset, as described infra). In an aspect, within a synchronization subframe, a set of SS blocks may be transmitted, where each SS block in the set of SS blocks may correspond to a respective beam direction and may include the processed synchronization signal. Thus, in such an aspect, one or more of the synchronization signals may be repeated within a SS block. In an aspect, an ESS may be used (e.g., by the UE) to identify the symbol and slot/subframe index of the detected/received synchronization signal. In an aspect, a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) for PBCH signals may be used (e.g., instead of the ESS) to identify the symbol and slot/subframe index of the detected/received synchronization signal. In an aspect, an ESS may be used to identify a part of the SS block index or the entire SS block index. In an aspect, an ESS may be used to identify a part of the symbol and slot/subframe index of the detected/received synchronization signal or the entire symbol and slot/subframe index. In an aspect, a DMRS for a PBCH signal may be used to serve the purposes of ESS. Thus, in such an aspect, for example, a DMRS for a PBCH signal may convey a part of a symbol and slot/subframe index of the detected/received synchronization signal or the entire symbol and slot/subframe index. For example, a DMRS for a PBCH signal may convey a part of the SS block index or the entire SS block index. In an aspect, the base station may set a numerology such that the numerology (e.g., tone spacing) for a synchronization signal is different from a numerology (e.g., tone spacing) for a data signal. The numerology (e.g., tone spacing) for the synchronization signal may be greater than the numerology (e.g., tone spacing) for the data signal. The base station may transmit the synchronization signal based on the numerology for the synchronization signal, and may transmit the data signal based on the numerology for the data signal. The synchronization signal may include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, and a PBCH. The data signal may include one or more PDSCH signals. In one aspect, PDSCH signals may carry remaining minimum system information (RMSI) and/or other system information (OSI). In one aspect, the numerology for the data signal may indicate the numerology of RMSI and/or OSI. In an aspect, a numerology for a signal may --> determine the duration of a transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a signal transmitted by the base station. For example, the duration of the transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a processed synchronization signal may be a function of the numerology and/or tone spacing for the processed synchronization signal. For example, the duration of the transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a data signal may be a function of the numerology and/or tone spacing for the data signal. The base station may use the numerology for the processed synchronization signal and/or the numerology for the data signal. The data signal may include a PDSCH signal and/or a PUSCH signal. The base station may declare such numerology information and/or tone spacing in the system information transmitted to the UE. The system information may be a master information block (MIB) and/or a system information block (SIB), etc. The MIB may be conveyed via a PBCH signal. The SIB may be conveyed via RMSI and/or OSI. In another aspect, a duration for a transmission of a signal may be a fixed value regardless of the numerology used. Because the numerology information is provided to the UE (e.g., via the system information), when the UE receives a synchronization signal, the UE may consider a corresponding numerology to receive the synchronization signal. When the UE receives a data signal, the UE may consider a corresponding numerology to receive the data signal. For example, the UE may consider tone spacing for synchronization signals when receiving the synchronization signals, and the UE may consider tone spacing for data signals when receiving the data signals. In an aspect, the base station may signal to the UE through broadcast or unicast to associate a beam with a PRACH and/or a scheduling request opportunity. In one example, if the base station is configured to sweep in different directions via beam-forming, such association may provide benefits for downlink and uplink beam-forming. In another example, if the system is not configured to sweep in different directions via beam-forming, the UE may reuse LTE PRACH resource association because the UE may detect multiple beams, each with similar strength. In an aspect, the base station may transmit system information to the UE to indicate whether the processed synchronization signals is transmitted multiple times in different directions or multiple times in the same direction. The system information may be, for example, an MIB or a SIB. Then, the UE may determine which resources to use --> for the UE\\'s RACH transmission based on the system information and/or the received synchronization signals. In an aspect, different multiplexing combinations of the synchronization signals may be used. According to one approach, the base station may be configured to utilize time-division multiplex for all types of synchronization signals without utilizing frequency-division multiplex. According to another approach, the base station may be configured to utilize both time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals. For example, a base station may generate a first processed signal by frequency-division multiplexing a PSS and an SSS, and may generate a second processed signal by frequency-division multiplexing a PBCH signal and a BRS. Then, the base station may generate a processed synchronization signal by time-division multiplexing the first processed signal and the second processed signal. When the PSS and the SSS are frequency-division multiplexed, the PSS may be mapped to consecutive tones in a first subset of tones, whereas the SSS may be mapped to tones that are spaced apart (e.g. tones equally spaced apart) from each other in a second subset of tones. Thus, for example, in the second subset of tones, the tones mapped with the SSS are present in every N tones, where N is an integer number. FIG. 8 is an example diagram 800 illustrating communication between a user equipment and a base station, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The example diagram 800 involves communication between a UE 802 and a base station 804. In the example diagram 800, the base station 804 has fourteen antenna ports capable of beam-forming in fourteen directions. At 812, the base station 804 processes a group of synchronization signals, which includes time-division multiplexing at least some (e.g., two or more) of the synchronization signals. The base station 804 then transmits the group of the processed synchronization signals and repeats the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals in different beam directions via beam-forming, within a synchronization subframe. In particular, at 814, the base station 804 transmits the group of the processed synchronization signals via beam-forming in a first direction. At 816, the base station 804 repeats the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals via beam-forming in a second direction. The base station 804 may repeat the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals to transmit the processed --> synchronization signals in each of fourteen different directions via beam-forming. The base station may repeat the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals within a synchronization subframe. At 820, the base station 804 repeats the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals via beam-forming in the fourteenth direction. For example, the UE 802 may receive a beam transmitted in a direction close to a direction of the UE 802 for optimal reception of the synchronization signals. At 822, the UE 802 demultiplexes the group of the processed synchronization signal to obtain the synchronization signal. In an aspect, after 820, in a subsequent synchronization subframe, the base station 804 may process a second group of synchronization signals and transmit the second group of processed synchronization signals to the UE. The second group of synchronization signals may be different from the group of synchronization signals processed at 812. The base station 804 may transmit the second group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the second group of the processed synchronization signals in different directions of beams via beam-forming, within the subsequent synchronization subframe. FIG. 9 is an example diagram 900 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 912 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 914 to transmit the synchronization signals later in the radio frame. The RACH 916 may occur after the second synchronization channel 914. In this example, the base station processes the synchronization signals such that there is cyclic prefix between the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 952. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH, which results the processed synchronization signal 952. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 952 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times in fourteen directions via beam forming in a sweeping manner (e.g., sweeping the beam in fourteen directions to --> cover the entire sector). The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 952 may be 120 kHz. The PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. FIG. 10 is an example diagram 1000 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1012 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 1014 to transmit the synchronization signals later in the radio frame. The RACH 1016 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1014. In this example, the base station processes the synchronization signals such that there is cyclic prefix between the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1052. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH, which results the processed synchronization signal 1052. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1052 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times in fourteen directions via beam forming in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). For each beam-forming direction, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signal 1052 four times. Thus, when transmitting the processed synchronization signal 1052 in fourteen directions, the base station transmits the processed synchronization signal 1052 fifty-six times (14x4=56) in total. For each beam-forming direction, because the base station transmits the processed synchronization signal 1052 four times, the UE may receive the processed synchronization signal 1052 in different antenna subarrays (e.g., 4 subarrays) of the UE, and may determine an antenna subarray that provides an optimal result (e.g., best signal-to-noise ratio of the received synchronization signal). Each antenna subarray of the UE may correspond to a specific direction. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1052 may be 120 kHz. The received PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. --> In one aspect, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signal 1052 four consecutive times in each of the fourteen directions. For example, in this aspect, the base station may transmit in direction 1, direction 1, direction 1, direction 1, direction 2, direction 2, direction 2, direction, 2, ... direction 14, direction 14, direction 14, direction 14. In another aspect, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signal 1052 in each of the fourteen directions in a sweeping manner four times. For example, in this aspect, the base station may transmit in direction 1, 2, ..., 14, in direction 1, 2, ...,. 14, in direction 1, 2, ...,. 14, and in direction 1, 2, ...,. 14. FIGs. 11A and 11B are example diagrams 1100 and 1170 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 11A is an example diagram 1100 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals in a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. As shown in FIG. 11A, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1112 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 1114 to transmit the synchronization signals again later in the radio frame. The RACH 1116 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1114. In the example shown in FIGs. 11A and 11B, the base station processes the synchronization signals to insert a cyclic prefix between the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1152. Because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1152 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). The processed synchronization signal 1152 corresponds to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1170 illustrated in FIG. 11B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station performs time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1170, and then transmits time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1170 as the processed synchronization signal 1152 in one symbol. As illustrated in --> FIG. 11B, to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1170, the synchronization signals are processed by time-division multiplexing a PBCH/BRS 1176 and a frequency-division multiplex of a PSS 1172 and an SSS 1174. As illustrated in FIG. 11B, within one symbol (e.g., within one SS block), the PSS 1172 and the SSS 1174 may be transmitted during the same time period and in different resource blocks, and the PBCH/BRS 1176 may be subsequently transmitted in the same time period and in the same resource blocks. The PBCH/BRS (block) 1176 may be generated by frequency-division multiplexing the PBCH and BRS signals. The BRS signals may be used as beam reference signals for the UEs. The BRS signals may also be used as reference signals for PBCH tones. The PBCH tones may also have their own demodulation reference signals. Thus, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1152 in one symbol, the base station transmits the PSS and SSS during a first time period 1154 and transmits the PBCH and the BRS during a second time period 1156, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first and the second time periods 1154 and 1156. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1152 may be 240 kHz. The PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. FIGs. 12A and 12B are example diagrams 1200 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 12A is an example diagram 1200 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals in a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit one or more synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1212 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 1214 to repeat transmission of the synchronization signals at a later time in the subframe. The RACH 1216 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1214. In this example, the base station processes the synchronization signals such that a cyclic prefix is present between different synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1252. --> In this aspect of the disclosure, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that one or more synchronization signals may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1252. In this example, the SSS is repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1252. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH/BRS. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1252 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). The processed synchronization signal 1252 corresponds to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1270 illustrated in FIG. 12B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station performs time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1270, and then transmits time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1270 as the processed synchronization signal 1252 in one symbol. As illustrated in FIG. 12B, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing a PSS 1272, an SSS 1274, a repetition of the SSS 1276, and a PBCH/BRS 1278. In an aspect, a PBCH/BRS block may be generated by frequency-division multiplexing the PBCH signal and the BRS signal. As further illustrated in FIG. 12B, within one symbol (e.g., within one SS block), the PSS 1272, the SSS 1274, the repetition of the SSS 1276, and the PBCH/BRS 1278 may be transmitted in different time periods. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 12A, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1252 in one symbol, the base station may transmit the PSS during a first time period 1254, the SSS and a repetition of the SSS during a the second time period 1256, and the PBCH/BRS during a third time period 1258, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first, second, and third time periods 1254, 1256, and 1258. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1252 may be 120 kHz. The PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. FIG. 13 is an example diagram 1300 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the --> base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. FIG. 13 illustrates the same diagram as the example diagram 1200 of FIG. 12, and thus explanations of the processed synchronization signal 1352 is partially omitted for brevity. A tone spacing is inversely proportional to a symbol duration. The tone spacing for one synchronization signal may be different from the tone spacing for another synchronization signal. For example, in the processed synchronization signal 1352, the PSS has a tone spacing of 480 kHz and the duration of 2.083 microseconds, and the PBCH signal has a tone spacing of 480 kHz and the duration of 2.083 microseconds. In the processed synchronization signal 1352, for the SSS, the tone spacing is 240 kHz, and the duration is 4.167 microseconds. The SSS occupies one of every two tones, and the length of the SSS may be 63 sequences. A CP duration of the PSS and the PBCH is 148.81 ns, and a CP duration of the SSS is 297.62 ns. There may be 14 symbols in each subframe with 120 kHz tone spacing. FIGs. 14A and 14B are example diagrams 1400 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 14A is an example diagram 1400 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals over a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1412 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 1414 to transmit the synchronization signals again at a later time in the radio frame. The RACH 1416 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1414. The base station may process the synchronization signals such that a cyclic prefix is present between different synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1452. In this aspect of the disclosure, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that one or more synchronization signals may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1452. The PBCH/BRS may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1452. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH/BRS. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the --> processed synchronization signal 1452 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). Thus, the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1452 may be performed fourteen times within the first synchronization channel 1412. The processed synchronization signal 1452 having cyclic prefixes corresponds to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1470 illustrated in FIG. 14B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station may perform time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1470, and then transmit time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1470 as the processed synchronization signal 1452 with cyclic prefixes in one symbol. In this example, as illustrated in FIG. 14B, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing a PSS 1472, an SSS 1474, a PBCH/BRS 1476, and a repetition of PBCH/BRS 1478. In an aspect, a PBCH/BRS block may be generated from frequency-division multiplexing of PBCH and BRS signals. As illustrated in FIG. 14B, within one symbol (e.g., within one SS block), the PSS 1472, the SSS 1474, the PBCH/BRS 1476, and a repetition of PBCH/BRS 1478 may be transmitted in different time periods. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 14A, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1452 in one symbol, the base station may transmit the PSS during a first time period 1454, the SSS during a the second time period 1456, and the PBCH/BRS and the repetition of the PBCH/BRS during a third time period 1458, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first, second, and third time periods 1454, 1456, and 1458. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1452 may be 120 kHz. The PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. FIGs. 15A and 15B are example diagrams 1500 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 15A is an example diagram 1500 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals over a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In --> particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1512 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 1514 to transmit the synchronization signals at a later time in the radio frame. The RACH 1516 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1514. The base station may process the synchronization signals such that a cyclic prefix is present between different synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1552. In this aspect of the disclosure, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that one or more synchronization signals may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1552, where a synchronization signal and a repetition of the synchronization signal are spaced apart in time during time-division multiplexing. In this example, the SSS may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1552. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH/BRS. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1552 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). The processed synchronization signal 1552 having cyclic prefixes may correspond to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1570 illustrated in FIG. 15B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station may perform time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1570, and then transmit time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1570 as the processed synchronization signal 1552 with cyclic prefixes in one symbol. As illustrated in FIG. 15B, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing a PSS 1572, an SSS 1574, a PBCH/BRS 1576, and a repetition of the SSS 1578, where the SSS 1574 and the repetition of the SSS 1578 are spaced apart from each other in time with the PBCH/BRS 1576 between the SSS 1574 and the repetition of the SSS 1578. In an aspect, a PBCH/BRS block may be generated by frequency-division multiplexing the PBCH signal and the BRS signal. As illustrated in FIG. 15B, within one symbol (e.g., within one SS block), the PSS 1572, the SSS 1574, the PBCH/BRS 1576, and a repetition of the SSS 1578 may be transmitted in different time periods. Thus, as --> illustrated in FIG. 15A, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1552 in one symbol, the base station may transmit the PSS during a first time period 1554, the SSS during a the second time period 1556, and the PBCH/BRS in a third time period 1558, and the repetition of the SSS during a fourth time period 1560, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first, second, third, and fourth time periods 1554, 1556, 1558, and 1560. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1552 may be 120 kHz. The PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. FIGs. 16A and 16B are example diagrams 1600 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 16A is an example diagram 1600 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals over a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal twice within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1612 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals, and then use a second synchronization channel 1614 to transmit the synchronization signals at a later time in the radio frame. The RACH 1616 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1614. The base station may process the synchronization signals such that a cyclic prefix is present between different synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1652. In this aspect of the disclosure, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that one or more synchronization signals may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1652, where a synchronization signal and a repetition of the synchronization signal are spaced apart in time during time-division multiplexing. The PBCH/BRS may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1652. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH/BRS. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1652 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). The --> processed synchronization signal 1652 having cyclic prefixes may correspond to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1670 illustrated in FIG. 16B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station may perform time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1670, and then transmit time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1670 as the processed synchronization signal 1652 with cyclic prefixes in one symbol. In an aspect, a PBCH/BRS block may be generated from frequency-division multiplexing of PBCH and BRS signals. As illustrated in FIG. 16B, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing a PBCH/BRS 1672, a PSS 1674, an SSS 1676, and a repetition of the PBCH/BRS 1678, where the PBCH/BRS 1672 and the repetition of the PBCH/BRS 1678 are spaced apart from each other in time with the PSS 1674 and the SSS 1676 between the PBCH/BRS 1672 and the repetition of the PBCH/BRS 1678. As illustrated in FIG. 16B, within one symbol (e.g., within one SS block), the PBCH/BRS 1672, the PSS 1674, the SSS 1676, and the repetition of the PBCH/BRS 1678 may be transmitted in different time periods. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 16A, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1652 in one symbol, the base station may transmit the PBCH/BRS during a first time period 1654, the PSS during a the second time period 1656, and the SSS in a third time period 1658, and the repetition of the PBCH/BRS during a fourth time period 1660, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first, second, third, and fourth time periods 1654, 1656, 1658, and 1660. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1652 may be 120 kHz. The PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. FIGs. 17A and 17B are example diagrams 1700 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 17A is an example diagram 1700 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals over a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit synchronization signals such as a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal in two sessions (e.g., a first session using a first synchronization channel 1712 and a second session using second synchronization channel 1714) within one radio frame. In this example, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may --> transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1712 first within a radio frame to transmit the synchronization signals (e.g., during a first synchronization subframe), and then use a second synchronization channel 1714 to transmit the synchronization signals later (e.g., during a second synchronization subframe). The RACH 1716 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1714. In this example, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that a cyclic prefix is present between different synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1732. In this aspect of the disclosure, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that a PBCH signal may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1732. In an aspect, a PBCH signal and a repeated PBCH signal may be spaced apart in time during time-division multiplexing (e.g., for estimation of a carrier frequency offset, as discussed infra). The PBCH signal may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1732. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the PBCH. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1732 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). The processed synchronization signal 1732 having cyclic prefixes may correspond to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1770 illustrated in FIG. 17B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station may perform time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1770, and then transmit time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1770 as the processed synchronization signal 1732 with cyclic prefixes in one nominal symbol (e.g., 17.89 microseconds). As illustrated in FIG. 17B, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing a PBCH 1772, a PSS 1774, an SSS 1776, and a repetition of the PBCH 1778, where the PBCH 1772 and the repetition of the PBCH 1778 may be spaced apart from each other in time with the PSS 1774 and the SSS 1776 between the PBCH 1772 and the repetition of the PBCH 1778 (e.g., for estimation of a carrier frequency offset, as discussed infra). The PBCH 1772 and the repetition of the PBCH 1778 may be identical in that the signal transmitted for the repetition --> of the PBCH 1778 and the antenna port and a beam for the transmission of the repetition of the PBCH 1778 are identical to those for the transmission of the PBCH 1778. Although the order of the PSS 1774 and the SSS 1776 in the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1770 shows that the PSS 1774 before the SSS 1767, the order may be reversed in another example. As illustrated in FIG. 17B, the bandwidths of the PBCH 1772, the PSS 1774, the SSS 1776, and the repetition of the PBCH 1778 may be the same. For example, the bandwidth may be 36 MHz (150 REs with 24kHz tone spacing). However, in another example, a bandwidth of a PSS may be smaller than a bandwidth of an SSS and/or a bandwidth of a PBCH/repeated PBCH. As illustrated in FIG. 17B, within one nominal symbol, the PBCH 1772, the PSS 1774, the SSS 1776, and the repetition of the PBCH 1778 may be transmitted in different time periods. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 17A, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1732 in one symbol, the base station may transmit the PBCH during a first time period 1734, the PSS during a the second time period 1736, and the SSS in a third time period 1738, and the repetition of the PBCH during a fourth time period 1740, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first, second, third, and fourth time periods 1734, 1736, 1738, and 1740. Each of the first, second, third, and fourth time periods 1734, 1736, 1738, and 1740 may correspond to an OFDM symbol. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1732 may be 120 kHz. For example, each OFDM symbol may have 4x the nominal subcarrier spacing, thus may have 1/4 of the length in time of the nominal symbol. Thus, the nominal symbol duration may be divided into the four OFDM symbols, where the four OFDM symbols respectively correspond to the transmission times for PBCH 1772, the PSS 1774, the SSS 1776, and the repetition of the PBCH 1778. FIGs. 18A and 18B are example diagrams 1800 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. FIG. 18A is an example diagram 1800 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals over a radio frame, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The base station may transmit a first group of synchronization signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal in one session (e.g., using a first synchronization channel 1812) and may transmit a second group of synchronization signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a BRS signal --> in a subsequent session (e.g., using a second synchronization channel 1814), within one radio frame. In particular, during the first synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the first group of processed synchronization signals multiple times (e.g., 14 times) using multiple beams in different directions. During the second synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the second group of processed synchronization signals multiple times (e.g., 14 times) using the multiple beams in different directions. Thus, for example, if the base station transmits the first group of processed synchronization signals 14 times, then 14 transmit beams in 14 directions are used for such a transmission, and if the base station transmits the second group of processed synchronization signals 14 times, the same 14 transmit beams in the same 14 directions may be used for such a transmission. That is, in this example, the 1st through 14th beams used for the first synchronization subframe may respectively correspond with the 1st through 14th beams for the second synchronization subframe. In the example diagram 1800 of FIG. 18A, because the radio frame is 10 milliseconds long, the base station may transmit synchronization signals every 5 milliseconds. In particular, the base station may use a first synchronization channel 1812 first within a radio frame to transmit the first group of the synchronization signals (e.g., during a first synchronization subframe), and then use a second synchronization channel 1814 to transmit the second group of the synchronization signals at a later time/subframe in the radio frame (e.g., during a second synchronization subframe). The RACH 1816 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1814. The base station may process the synchronization signals such that a cyclic prefix is present between different synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1832. In this aspect of the disclosure, during the first synchronization subframe, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that a PBCH signal may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1832. For example, during the first synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the first group of synchronization signals including a PBCH, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the PBCH. In an aspect, a PBCH signal and a repeated PBCH signal may be spaced apart in time during time-division multiplexing (e.g., for estimation of a carrier frequency offset, as discussed infra). The processing and transmission of the --> synchronization signals during the first synchronization subframe using the first synchronization channel 1812 may be similar to the processing and transmission of the synchronization signals during the first synchronization subframe using the first synchronization channel 1712, as discussed above in reference to FIGs. 17A and 17B. Further, the processed synchronization signal 1832 may correspond to time-division multiplexed synchronization signals similar to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1770 illustrated in FIG. 17B. Thus, detailed explanations about the processed synchronization signal 1832 and a corresponding time-division multiplexed synchronization signals are omitted. During the second synchronization subframe, the base station may process the synchronization signals such that a BRS signal may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1852. For example, during the second synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the second group of synchronization signals including a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the BRS. In an aspect, a BRS signal and a repeated BRS signal may be spaced apart in time during time-division multiplexing. The BRS signal may be repeated in the processed synchronization signal 1852. As discussed above, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing the PSS, the SSS, and the BRS. In this case, because there are fourteen symbols, transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1852 (e.g., per symbol) may be performed fourteen times via beam-forming in fourteen directions in a sweeping manner (e.g., to cover the entire sector). The processed synchronization signal 1852 having cyclic prefixes may correspond to the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1880 illustrated in FIG. 18B. In particular, when the base station determines to transmit synchronization signals, the base station may perform time-division multiplexing of the synchronization signals to generate the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1880, and then transmit time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1880 as the processed synchronization signal 1852 with cyclic prefixes in one nominal symbol (e.g., 17.89 microseconds). As illustrated in FIG. 18B, the synchronization signals may be processed by time-division multiplexing a BRS 1882, a PSS 1884, an SSS 1886, and a repetition of the BRS 1888, where the BRS 1882 and the repetition of the BRS 1888 are spaced apart from each other in time with the PSS 1884 and the SSS 1886 between the BRS 1882 and the repetition of the BRS 1888. The BRS 1882 and the --> repetition of the BRS 1888 may be identical in that the signal transmitted for the repetition of the BRS 1888 and the antenna port and a beam for the transmission of the repetition of the BRS 1888 may be identical to those for the transmission of the BRS 1888. Although the order of the PSS 1884 and the SSS 1886 in the time-division multiplexed synchronization signals 1880 shows that the PSS 1884 before the SSS 1887, the order may be reversed in another example. As illustrated in FIG. 18B, the bandwidths of the BRS 1882, the PSS 1884, the SSS 1886, and the repetition of the BRS 1888 may be the same. For example, the bandwidth may be 36 MHz. In an aspect, a bandwidth of a BRS (e.g., BRS 1882 or the repetition of the BRS 1888) may be wider than a bandwidth of a bandwidth of a PBCH/repeated PBCH. As illustrated in FIG. 18B, within one nominal symbol, the BRS 1882, the PSS 1884, the SSS 1886, and the repetition of the BRS 1888 may be transmitted in different time periods. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 18A, during the transmission of the processed synchronization signal 1852 in one symbol, the base station may transmit the PBCH during a first time period 1854, the PSS during a the second time period 1856, and the SSS in a third time period 1858, and the repetition of the PBCH during a fourth time period 1860, with a cyclic prefix before the beginning of each of the first, second, third, and fourth time periods 1854, 1856, 1858, and 1860. Each of the first, second, third, and fourth time periods 1854, 1856, 1858, and 1860 may correspond to an OFDM symbol. The tone spacing for each of the synchronization signals in the processed synchronization signal 1852 may be 120 kHz. For example, each OFDM symbol may have 4x the nominal subcarrier spacing, thus may have 1/4 of the length in time of the nominal symbol. Thus, the nominal symbol duration may be divided into the four OFDM symbols, where the four OFDM symbols respectively corresponds to the transmission times for BRS 1882, the PSS 1884, the SSS 1886, and the repetition of the BRS 1888. In an aspect, a UE may estimate a channel within a 36 MHz bandwidth using an SSS, which is transmitted in all subframes, or may estimate a channel within a 36 MHz bandwidth using a BRS, which is transmitted in every other subframe. Further, the UE may estimate a channel outside the 36 MHz bandwidth using a BRS, which is transmitted in every other subframe. --> In an aspect, the UE may determine whether the UE is receiving a signal in the first synchronization subframe or the second synchronization subframe. If the UE determines that the UE is receiving a signal in the first synchronization subframe, the UE may receive and decode the PBCH from the signal. If the UE determines that the UE is receiving a signal in the second synchronization subframe, the UE may receive and decode the BRS from the signal. Decoding the BRS may include detecting a beam identifier, measuring an RSRP or other beam quality measurements, and estimating channel for one or more beams. In an aspect of the disclosure, the base station may determine whether to transmit a BRS. If the base station determines to transmit a BRS, the base station may include an indication of the presence of BRS transmission in a PBCH transmitted to the UE, such that the UE may determine to a decode a BRS and may transmit the BRS. If the base station determines not to transmit a BRS, the base station may include an indication of absence of BRS transmission in a PBCH transmitted to the UE, such that the UE may determine not to a decode a BRS. If the base station determines not to transmit a BRS, the base station may transmit a PBCH instead of the BRS. FIG. 19 is an example diagram 1900 illustrating transmission of synchronization signals, according to an aspect of the disclosure. The example diagram 1900 illustrates that the base station determines to transmit a BRS in the first radio frame, and determines not to transmit a BRS in the second radio frame. In particular, during the first synchronization subframe of the first radio frame, the base station may use the first synchronization channel 1910 to transmit a PBCH 1912, a PSS 1914, an SSS 1916, and a repetition of the PBCH 1918. When the base station determines to transmit a BRS in the first radio frame, the base station may send the UE an indication indicating a presence of a BRS transmission in the PBCH 1912 and/or the repetition of the PBCH 1918 (e.g., in the first synchronization subframe), such that the UE may expect to decode a BRS (e.g., from the second synchronization subframe). During the second synchronization subframe of the first radio frame, the base station may use the second synchronization channel 1930 to transmit a BRS 1932, a PSS 1934, an SSS 1936, and a repetition of the BRS 1938. The RACH 1940 may occur after the second synchronization channel 1930. --> During the first synchronization subframe of the second radio frame, the base station may use the third synchronization channel 1950 to transmit a PBCH 1952, a PSS 1954, an SSS 1956, and a repetition of the PBCH 1958. When the base station determines not to transmit a BRS in the second radio frame, the base station may indicate an absence of BRS transmission in the PBCH 1952 and/or the repetition of the PBCH 1958, such that the UE may not expect to decode a BRS. Because the base station determines not to transmit a BRS in the second radio frame, the base station instead transmits a PBCH during the second synchronization subframe of the second radio frame. In particular, during the second synchronization subframe of the second radio frame, the base station may use the fourth synchronization channel 1970 to transmit a PBCH 1972, a PSS 1974, an SSS 1976, and a repetition of the PBCH 1978. In an aspect, the base station may indicate in a PBCH allocation information of a BRS in time and/or frequency. In an aspect, the base station may frequency-division multiplex a BRS with one or more of a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH. In an aspect, the base station may indicate in a PBCH a location of a BRS to be frequency-division multiplexed with one or more signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH. In an aspect, the base station may further indicate in a PBCH locations of one or more signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH that are to be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS. The locations may be indicated in time and/or frequency. In an aspect, when a base station repeats a transmission of a synchronization signal (e.g., PBCH) of multiple synchronization signals, the UE may estimate a carrier frequency offset (CFO) based on the synchronization signal and the repeated synchronization signal before the UE decodes the synchronization signal. As discussed above, the base station may transmit a PBCH and a repeated PBCH to the UE (e.g., a PBCH 1672 and a repetition of the PBCH 1678 in FIG. 16B, a PBCH 1772 and a repetition of the PBCH 1778 in FIG. 17B). For example, the UE may initially have a different carrier frequency than the base station due to a CFO, although the UE should have the same carrier frequency as the base station. Thus, the UE may correct the carrier frequency of the UE over time based on the estimated CFO (e.g., so as to minimize the CFO). When the UE receives a PBCH and a repeated PBCH, the UE may estimate a CFO based on the PBCH and the repeated --> PBCH. Because the PBCH and the repeated PBCH should be identical, the UE may estimate a CFO based on a difference (e.g., in frequency and/or time) between a received transmission of PBCH and a received repeated transmission of the PBCH. If the transmission time for the PBCH is too close in time to the transmission time for the repeated PBCH, then the CFO may be too small to be measurable by the UE. Thus, having the PBCH and the repetition of the PBCH spaced apart from each other in time with another synchronization signal (e.g., a PSS or an SSS) between the PBCH and the repetition of the PBCH may be more beneficial for CFO estimation than having the PBCH adjacent to the repetition of the PBCH. On the other hand, if the transmission time for the PBCH is too far apart in time from the transmission time for the repeated PBCH, the signal may go through a 2π rotation between the transmission of the PBCH and the transmission of the repeated PBCH and/or the channel conditions may change significantly, which may make estimation of the CFO more difficult. Thus, for example, configuring the transmission of the PBCH to be one or two OFDM symbols apart from the transmission of the repeated PBCH may be beneficial. FIG. 20 is an example diagram 2000 illustrating an example procedure by a UE to process received signals. As discussed above, the base station may transmit a first PBCH signal and a second PBCH signal (e.g., a PBCH 1672 and a repetition of the PBCH 1678 in FIG. 16B, a PBCH 1772 and a repetition of the PBCH 1778 in FIG. 17B) to the UE, such that the UE may estimate a CFO based on the two PBCH signals. The UE may estimate the CFO based on the two PBCH signals (e.g., the first PBCH signal and the second PBCH signal) and a PSS. At 2002, the UE may search for a PSS and receive the PSS based on the search. In an example, the UE may receive a first PBCH signal before receiving the PSS. When the UE receives the PSS, the UE may make a coarse estimation of the CFO based on the received PSS and an expected transmission of the PSS. At 2004, the UE may receive a second PBCH signal and refine the estimation of the CFO based on the coarse estimation and a difference between the first PBCH signal and the second PBCH signal, to determine the estimated CFO. The second PBCH signal may be a repetition of the second PBCH signal. At 2006, the UE may detect an SSS using the estimated CFO, and may receive the detected SSS. At 2008, the UE may decode a PBCH using the estimated CFO. --> At 2010, the UE may select a receive beam out of multiple receive beams based on the two BPCHs received at the UE. In particular, when the UE receives the two PBCHs in two OFDM symbols, the UE may use different receive beams to receive the two PBCHs respectively. Based on the signal conditions (e.g., RSRP) of the two received PBCHs using the respective receive beams, the UE may determine a receive beam with the best reception condition (e.g., highest RSRP). In an aspect, the UE may additionally use SSS in addition to the two PBCHs to select a receive beam out of multiple receive beams, by considering a reception condition (e.g., RSRP) for the received SSS. Thus, the UE may consider a receive beam used to receive a PBCH, a receive beam used to receive a repletion of the PBCH, and a receive beam used to receive an SSS, and select one of the three receive beams based on the reception conditions for each of the three receive beams. FIG. 21 is an example diagram 2100 illustrating frequency mapping for synchronization signals being frequency-division multiplexed. When two synchronization signals (e.g., an SSS and a PSS) are frequency-division multiplexed, the first signal 2112 may be mapped to a first subset 2152 of tones, where the tones used to map the first signal 2112 are adjacent to each other in the first subset 2152 of tones. The second signal 2114 may be mapped to a second subset 2154 of tones that is different from the first subset 2152 of tones, where the tones used to map the second signal 2114 are spaced apart from each other by null tones, e.g., tones with no signal. The tones used to map the second signal 2114 may be spaced from each other by an equal number of null tones (e.g., tones with zero tone values). FIG. 22 is a flowchart 2200 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\'). At 2202, the base station may process a plurality of synchronization signals by performing TDM of at least one first synchronization signal of a plurality of first synchronization signals of different types and at least one second synchronization signal of the plurality of second synchronization signals of different types, the plurality of synchronization signals including the plurality of first synchronization signals and the plurality of second synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may process the synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing at least one first synchronization signal from --> the plurality of first synchronization signals and at least one second synchronization signal from the plurality of second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the base station may process the plurality of synchronization signals by: generating a first multiplexed signal by performing at least one of FDM of at least two first synchronization signals of the plurality of first synchronization signals or TDM of at least two second synchronization signals of the plurality of first synchronization signals, generating a second multiplexed signal by performing at least one of FDM of at least two second synchronization signals of the plurality of second synchronization signals or TDM of at least two second synchronization signals of the plurality of second synchronization signals, and performing the TDM of the first multiplexed signal and the second multiplexed signal. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may process the first synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing or frequency-division multiplexing the synchronization signals within the first synchronization signals, and may process the second synchronization signals by time-division multiplexing or frequency-division multiplexing the synchronization signals within the second synchronization signals, and, subsequently, may time-division multiplex the processed first synchronization signals and the processed second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the first multiplexed signal may be generated by: performing at least one of FDM or TDM of two first synchronization signals of the plurality of first synchronization signals, mapping one of the two first synchronization signals to a first subset of tones, and mapping the other one of the two first synchronization signals to a second subset of tones, the second subset of tones different from the first subset of tones. In an aspect, tones in the second subset of tones may be equally spaced from each other in a frequency domain. For example, as discussed supra, when the PSS and the SSS are frequency-division multiplexed, the PSS is mapped to consecutive tones in a first subset of tones, whereas the SSS is mapped to tones that are spaced apart (e.g. equally spaced apart) from each other in a second subset of tones. In an aspect, the plurality of the synchronization signals may be processed without performing FDM of the at least one of the plurality of synchronization signals with at least one of a plurality of data channel signals. In such an aspect, the plurality of data channel signals may include one or more PDSCH signals. For --> example, as discussed supra, the base station may avoid frequency-division multiplexing one or more of the synchronization signals and one or more of data channel signals (e.g., PDSCH signals, PUSCH signals). In an aspect, the plurality of first synchronization signals may include at least one of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH signal. In an aspect, the plurality of second synchronization signals may include at least one of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH signal. For example, as discussed supra, the first synchronization signals may include a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH signal, and the second synchronization signals may include a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH. In an aspect, a tone spacing of each of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals and a second tone spacing of at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals may be different from each other. For example, as discussed supra, the PSS and the PBCH may have a tone spacing of 480 kHz, and an SSS may have a tone spacing of 240 KHz. At 2204, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signals to a UE. For example, as discussed supra, after processing the synchronization signal, the base station transmits the processed synchronization signals to the UE. In an aspect, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signals by: transmitting a synchronization signal block via each beam of a plurality of beams of the base station, the plurality of beams corresponding to a plurality of directions, respectively, the synchronization signal block including two or more of the processed synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may transmit the synchronization signals in a synchronization signal block (SS block), where each SS block corresponds to a respective direction of a beam of the base station. In an aspect, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signals by: performing a first transmission by transmitting a first group of the processed synchronization signals, and performing one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission, where each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission includes a repetition of the first transmission, where the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmission of the first transmission are performed within a first synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission are --> each performed using a different beam of a plurality of beams of the base station, each beam corresponding to a different direction, respectively. In such an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmission may be performed multiple times within the first synchronization subframe. For example, as discussed supra, after processing a group of synchronization signals, the base station 804 transmits the group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals in different directions of beams via beam-forming, within a synchronization subframe (e.g., at 814-820 of FIG. 8). In an aspect, the first transmission may include a transmission of at least one of the processed first synchronization signals in the first group being repeated at least once during each of the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions in the first synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 17B, within the first synchronization subframe, a PBCH may be repeated at least once during each transmission. In an aspect, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signals further by: performing a second transmission of a second group of the processed synchronization signals, performing one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, where the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are performed within a second synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission may each be performed using a respective beam of a plurality of beams, each beam transmitted in a respective direction of a plurality of directions, and the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission may each be performed using a respective beam of the plurality of beams, each beam transmitted in a respective direction of the plurality of directions. For example, as discussed supra, after processing a second group of synchronization signals, the base station 804 may transmit the second group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the second group of the processed synchronization signals in different directions of beams via beam-forming, within the subsequent synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first group of the processed synchronization signals may include a first one of the --> processed second synchronization signals and the second group of the processed synchronization signals may include a second one of the processed second synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18A, the synchronization signals transmitted during a first synchronization subframe may include a PBCH, and the synchronization signals transmitted during a second synchronization subframe may include a BRS. In such an aspect, the first transmission may include a transmission of the first one of the processed second synchronization signals in the first group being repeated at least once during each of the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission in the first synchronization subframe, and the second transmission may include a transmission of the second one of the processed second synchronization signals in the second group being repeated at least once during each of the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission in the second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 17B, within the first synchronization subframe, a PBCH may be repeated at least once during each transmission. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 18B, during the second synchronization subframe, a BRS may be repeated at least once during each transmission. In an aspect, the first group of the processed synchronization signals may include a PBCH signal, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the PBCH signal, and the second group of the processed synchronization signals may include a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 18B, the processed synchronization signals include a PBCH, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the PBCH, and the processed synchronization signal 1852 include a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the BRS. In an aspect, the base station may transmit the processed synchronization signals further by: determining whether to transmit a BRS in a second transmission, performing the second transmission, wherein the second transmission is performed by transmitting a second group of the processed synchronization signals including the BRS if the BRS is to be transmitted in the second transmission, and the second transmission is performed by transmitting the first group of the processed synchronization signals without the BRS if the BRS is not to be transmitted in the second transmission, and performing one or more repeat transmissions of the second --> transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, where the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are performed within a second synchronization subframe. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may determine whether to transmit a BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 19, in the first radio frame, if the BRS is to be transmitted in the second synchronization subframe of the first radio frame, the base station may transmit a BRS 1932, a PSS 1934, an SSS 1936, and a repetition of the BRS 1938 during the second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 19, in the second radio frame, if the BRS is not to be transmitted in the second synchronization subframe of the second radio frame, the base station may transmit a PBCH 1972, a PSS 1974, an SSS 1976, and a repetition of the PBCH 1978. In such an aspect, the BRS may be frequency-division multiplexed with at least one of a PBCH signal, a PSS, an SSS. In such an aspect, the BRS may be frequency-division multiplexed based on at least one of a location of the BRS or a location of the at least one of the PBCH signal, the PSS, and the SSS. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may frequency-division multiplex a BRS with one or more of a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may indicate in a PBCH a location of a BRS to be frequency-division multiplexed with one or more signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may further indicate in a PBCH locations of one or more signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH that are to be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS In an aspect, at 2206, the base station may perform additional features, as discussed infra. FIG. 23A is a flowchart 2300 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 2200 of FIG. 22. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\'). At 2206, the base station may continue from the flowchart 2200 of FIG. 22. At 2302, the base station may transmit another one of the plurality of second synchronization signals within the first synchronization subframe, wherein the transmission of the another one of the plurality of second synchronization signals is not repeated during the first synchronization subframe. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may --> transmit in a synchronization channel subframe a synchronization signal that is not repeated. For example, as discussed supra, the non-repeated synchronization signal may be an ESS. FIG. 23B is a flowchart 2350 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 2200 of FIG. 22. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\'). At 2206, the base station may continue from the flowchart 2200 of FIG. 22. At 2352, the base station transmits system information including an indication of whether the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions are transmitted in a same direction or are transmitted in different directions. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may transmit system information to the UE to indicate whether the processed synchronization signals should be transmitted multiple times in different directions or in the same direction. ...by............FIG. 24 is a flowchart 2300 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 2200 of FIG. 22. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\'). At 2206, the base station may continue from the flowchart 2200 of FIG. 22. In an aspect, a duration of the first transmission and a duration of the at least one repeat transmission may be determined based at least on a frame numerology of the wireless communication or are fixed values independent of the frame numerology. For example, as discussed supra, in an aspect, a duration of a transmission of a processed synchronization signal may be a function of numerology used. For example, as discussed supra, in an aspect, a duration for the transmission may be fixed regardless of a numerology used. At 2402, the base station transmits an indication of at least one of the frame numerology or a tone spacing scheme used for the wireless communication via at least one of system information or one or more of the plurality of synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may declare such numerology information and/or tone spacing in the system information transmitted to the UE. In an aspect, the system information may be conveyed in at least one of a MIB or a SIB. For example, as discussed supra, the system information may be included in a MIB and/or a SIB, etc. In an aspect, the SIB may be transmitted via at least one of RMSI or OSI. For example, as discussed supra, the SIB may be conveyed via RMSI and/or OSI. --> FIG. 25 is a flowchart 2500 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\'). At 2502, the base station processes a first group of synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 17 and 18, the base station may process a first group of synchronization signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a PBCH signal by performing time-division multiplexing on the first group of synchronization signals. At 2504, the base station processes a second group of synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the base station may process a second group of synchronization signals including a PSS, an SSS, and a BRS by performing time-division multiplexing on the second group of synchronization signals. In an aspect, the first group of synchronization signals may be processed by performing TDM of the first group of synchronization signals, and the second group of synchronization signals may be processed by performing TDM of the second group of synchronization signals. At 2506, the base station performs a first transmission by transmitting the processed first group of the synchronization signals in a first synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the base station may transmit the first group of the synchronization signals by transmitting the processed synchronization signals including a PBCH, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of PBCH during the first synchronization subframe. At 2508, the base station performs a second transmission by transmitting the processed second group of the synchronization signals in a second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the base station may transmit the second group of the synchronization signals by transmitting the processed synchronization signals including a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of BRS during the second synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH, and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a BRS. In an aspect, the first group of the synchronization signals may further include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, and another PBCH signal, and the second group of the synchronization signals may further include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, and another BRS. In such an aspect, the another PBCH signal may be a duplicate of the --> PBCH signal and the another BRS may be a duplicate of the BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the PBCH and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the BRS. At 2510, the base station may perform additional features, as discussed infra. FIG. 26 is a flowchart 2600 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 2500 of FIG. 25. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\'). At 2510, the base station may continue from the flowchart 2500 of FIG. 25. At 2602, the base station may perform one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission includes a repetition of the first transmission, where the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmission of the first transmission are performed within the first synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the first synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the first group of processed synchronization signals multiple times (e.g., 14 times). In an aspect, the first transmission may include a transmission of at least one of the processed first synchronization signals in the first group being repeated at least once during each of the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions in the first synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 17B, within the first synchronization subframe, a PBCH may be repeated at least once during each transmission. At 2604, the base station may perform one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, where the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are performed within the second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the second synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the second group of processed synchronization signals multiple times (e.g., 14 times). In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission may each be performed using a respective beam of a plurality of beams, each beam transmitted in a respective direction of a plurality of directions, --> and the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission may each be performed using a respective beam of the plurality of beams, each beam transmitted in a respective direction of the plurality of directions. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the first synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the first group of processed synchronization signals multiple times using multiple beams in different directions, and during the second synchronization subframe, the base station may transmit the second group of processed synchronization signals multiple times using the multiple beams in different directions. In an aspect, the first group of the processed synchronization signals may include a first one of the second synchronization signals and the second group of the processed synchronization signals may include a second one of the second synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the processed synchronization signals may include a PBCH, and the second group of the processed synchronization signals may include a BRS. In such an aspect, the first transmission includes a transmission of the first one of the processed second synchronization signals in the first group being repeated at least once during each of the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission in the first synchronization subframe, and the second transmission includes a transmission of the second one of the processed second synchronization signals in the second group being repeated at least once during each of the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission in the second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 17B, during the first synchronization subframe, a PBCH may be repeated at least once during each transmission of the multiple transmissions of the first group of the synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 18B, during the second synchronization subframe, a BRS may be repeated at least once during each transmission of the multiple transmissions of the second group of the synchronization signals. FIG. 27 is a flowchart 2700 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a base station (e.g., the base station 804, the apparatus 2802/2802\\').

For example, as discussed supra, the data signal may include one or more of a PDSCH and a PUSCH. --> In an aspect, the first numerology of the at least one synchronization signal defines a first tone spacing and the second numerology of the at least one data signal defines a second tone spacing. For example, as discussed supra, the numerology for a synchronization signal may have a tone spacing different from a tone spacing for a data signal. In such an aspect, the at least one synchronization signal is transmitted at a first periodicity based on the first tone spacing and the at least one data signal is transmitted at a second periodicity based on the second tone spacing. For example, as discussed supra, a duration of a transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a processed synchronization signal may be a function of a numerology and/or tone spacing for the processed synchronization signal. For example, as discussed supra, a duration of a transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a data signal may be a function of a numerology and/or tone spacing for the data signal. In such an aspect, the first tone spacing for the at least one synchronization signal is greater than the second spacing for the at least one data signal.

In an aspect, the means for processing the plurality of synchronization signals is configured to: generate a first multiplexed signal by performing at least one of FDM of at least two first synchronization signals of the plurality of first synchronization signals or TDM of at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals, generate a second multiplexed signal by performing at least one of FDM of at least two second synchronization signals of the plurality of second synchronization signals or TDM of at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals, and perform the TDM of the first multiplexed signal and the second multiplexed signal. In an aspect, the means for transmitting the processed synchronization signals is configured to: perform a first transmission by transmitting a first group of the processed synchronization signals, and perform one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission includes a repetition of the first transmission, wherein the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmission of the first transmission are performed within a first synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the means for transmitting the processed synchronization signals is further configured to: perform a second transmission by transmitting a second group of the processed synchronization signals, and perform one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, wherein the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are performed within a second synchronization subframe. The aforementioned means may be one or more of the aforementioned components of the apparatus 2802 and/or the processing system 2914 of the apparatus 2802\\' configured to perform the functions recited by the aforementioned means. As described supra, the processing system 2914 may include the TX Processor 316, the RX Processor 370, and the controller/processor 375. As such, in one configuration, the aforementioned means may be the TX Processor 316, the RX Processor 370, and the controller/processor 375 configured to perform the functions recited by the aforementioned means. FIG. 30 is a flowchart 3000 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3002, the UE receives a plurality of synchronization signals that are processed with multiplexing, the plurality of synchronization signals including a plurality of first --> synchronization signals of different types and a plurality of second synchronization signals of different types. For example, as discussed supra, the UE receives processed synchronization signals that have been processed with first synchronization signals and second synchronization signals. At 3004, the UE demultiplexes the processed plurality of synchronization signals by performing time-division demultiplexing of at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals and at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may demultiplex the processed synchronization signals by time-division demultiplexing at least one synchronization signal from the first synchronization signals and at least one synchronization signal from the second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the UE may demultiplex the processed plurality of synchronization signals by: performing the time-division demultiplexing of at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals and at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals, performing at least one of frequency-division demultiplexing of the at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals or time-division demultiplexing of the at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals, and performing at least one of frequency-division demultiplexing of at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals or time-division demultiplexing of at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may demultiplex (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) first multiplexed synchronization signals that were multiplexed (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) within the first synchronization signals and demultiplex (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) second multiplexed synchronization signals that were multiplexed (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) within the second synchronization signals to produce a resulting synchronization signal, and may subsequently perform time-division demultiplex the resulting synchronization signals. In an aspect, the plurality of the synchronization signals are processed without performing FDM of at least one of the plurality of synchronization signals with at least one of a plurality of data channel signals. In such an aspect, the plurality of data channel signals include one or more PDSCH signals. For example, as discussed supra, the frequency-division multiplexing one or more of the --> synchronization signals and one or more of data channel signals may be avoided (e.g., PDSCH signals, PUSCH signals). In an aspect, the plurality of first synchronization signals include at least one of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH signal. In an aspect, the plurality of second synchronization signals include at least one of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH signal. For example, as discussed supra, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH, and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH. In an aspect, the UE receives the plurality of synchronization signals by receiving a synchronization signal block transmitted via at least one beam of a plurality of beams of the base station, the synchronization signal block including two or more of the processed synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may receive the synchronization signals in a synchronization signal block (SS block), where each SS block corresponds to a respective direction of a beam of the base station In an aspect, the UE receives the plurality of synchronization signals by: receiving a first transmission of a first group of the plurality of synchronization signals, and receiving one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission includes a repetition of the first transmission, where the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission are received within a first synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions are received using at least one of different beams of the UE in different directions. In such an aspect, within the first synchronization subframe, each of the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions are received using at least one of a plurality of antenna subarrays of the UE. For example, as discussed supra, after the base station 804 processes a group of synchronization signals, the UE 802 may receive the group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals within a synchronization subframe (e.g., at 814-820 of FIG. 8). For example, as discussed supra, the UE may have multiple antenna subarrays and may be capable of beamforming, and thus may utilize one or more beams to receive transmissions in different directions from the base station that are transmitted in the direction of the --> UE. In an aspect, reception of at least one of the processed first synchronization signals is repeated at least once during the first transmission. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 17B, within the first synchronization subframe, a PBCH may be repeated at least once during each transmission. In an aspect, the UE receives the plurality of synchronization signals further by: receiving a second transmission by receiving a second group of the plurality of synchronization signals, and receiving one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, where the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are received within a second synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission are received using at least one of a plurality of beams at a plurality of directions and the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are received using at least one of the plurality of beams at the plurality of directions. For example, as discussed supra, after the base station 804 processes a second group of synchronization signals, the UE 802 may receive the second group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the second group of the processed synchronization signals within the subsequent synchronization subframe. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may have multiple antenna subarrays and may be capable of beamforming, and thus may utilize one or more beams to receive the transmissions from the base station. In an aspect, the first transmission includes a transmission of the first one of the processed second synchronization signals in the first group being repeated at least once during each of the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission in the first synchronization subframe, and the second transmission includes a transmission of the second one of the processed second synchronization signals in the second group being repeated at least once during each of the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission in the second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 17B, within the first synchronization subframe, a PBCH may be repeated at least once during each transmission. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 18B, during the second synchronization subframe, a BRS may be repeated at least once during each transmission. In an aspect, the first group of the processed --> synchronization signals includes a PBCH signal, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the PBCH signal, and the second group of the processed synchronization signals includes a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 18A and 18B, the processed synchronization signals include a PBCH, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the PBCH, and the processed synchronization signal 1852 include a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a duplicate of the BRS In an aspect, the UE receives the plurality of synchronization signals further by: determining whether the UE is receiving in the first subframe or the second subframe, decoding a PBCH signal from the first transmission if the UE is receiving in the first subframe, and decoding a BRS from the second transmission if the UE is receiving in the second subframe. For example, as discussed supra, if the UE determines that the UE is receiving a signal in the first synchronization subframe, the UE may receive and decode the PBCH from the signal. For example, as discussed supra, if the UE determines that the UE is receiving a signal in the second synchronization subframe, the UE may receive and decode the BRS from the signal. In an aspect, the second group may include a BRS, and the BRS may be frequency-division multiplexed with at least one of a PBCH signal, a PSS, a SSS. In such an aspect, the BRS may be frequency-division multiplexed based on at least one of a location of the BRS or a location of the at least one of the PBCH signal, the PSS, and the SSS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH, a PSS, a SSS, and a repetition of the PBCH and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the BRS. At 3006, the UE may perform additional features, as discussed infra. FIG. 31A is a flowchart 3100 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3006, the UE continues from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. At 3102, the UE may receive another one of the plurality of second synchronization signals within the first synchronization subframe, wherein the reception of the another one of the plurality of second synchronization signals is not repeated during the first synchronization subframe. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may receive in a synchronization channel --> subframe a synchronization signal that is not repeated. For example, as discussed supra, the non-repeated synchronization signal may be an ESS. FIG. 31B is a flowchart 3150 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3006, the UE continues from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. At 3152, the UE may determine a subarray with a highest signal among the plurality of antenna subarrays based on signal reception at each time using a different antenna subarray of a plurality of antenna subarrays of the UE. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may receive the processed synchronization signal 1052 in different antenna subarrays (e.g., 4 subarrays) of the UE, and may determine an antenna subarray that provides an optimal result (e.g., best signal-to-noise ratio. FIG. 32 is a flowchart 3200 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3006, the UE continues from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. At 3202, the UE may receive system information including an indication about whether the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions are to be transmitted in a same direction or in different directions. For example, as discussed supra, the base station may transmit system information to the UE to indicate whether the processed synchronization signals are transmitted multiple times in different directions or multiple times in the same direction. At 3204, the UE may determine one or more resources for a RACH transmission based at least on the indication. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may determine which resources to use for the UE\\'s RACH transmission based on the system information and/or the received synchronization signals. FIG. 33 is a flowchart 3300 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3006, the UE continues from the flowchart 3000 of FIG. 30. In an aspect, a duration of the first transmission and a duration of the at least one repeat transmission are determined based at least on a frame numerology of the wireless communication or are fixed values independent of the frame numerology. For example, as discussed supra, in an aspect, a duration of a transmission of a processed synchronization signal may be a function of --> numerology used. For example, as discussed supra, in an aspect, a duration for the transmission may be fixed regardless of a numerology used. At 3302, the UE may receive an indication of at least one of the frame numerology or a tone spacing scheme used for the wireless communication by a base station via at least one of system information or one or more of the plurality of synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may receive numerology information and/or tone spacing in the system information transmitted to the UE. In an aspect, the system information may be included in at least one of a MIB or a SIB. For example, as discussed supra, the system information may be a master information block (MIB) and/or a system information block (SIB), etc. In an aspect, the SIB may be received via at least one of RMSI or OSI. For example, as discussed supra, the SIB may be conveyed via RMSI and/or OSI. FIG. 34 is a flowchart 3400 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3402, the UE receives, in a first synchronization subframe, a first transmission of a first group of synchronization signals processed by processing the first group of synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the first synchronization subframe, the UE may receive, from the base station, the first group of processed synchronization signals multiple times (e.g., 14 times) using multiple beams in different directions. At 3404, the UE receives, in a second synchronization subframe, a second transmission of a second group of synchronization signals processed by processing the second group of synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the second synchronization subframe, the UE may receive, from the base station, the second group of processed synchronization signals multiple times (e.g., 14 times) using the multiple beams in different directions. In an aspect, the first group of synchronization signals may be processed by TDM of the first group of synchronization signals, and the second group of synchronization signals may be processed by TDM of the second group of synchronization signals. At 3406, the UE performs time-division demultiplexing of the processed first group of synchronization signals and the processed second group of synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, when the UE receives the processed synchronization signals from the base station, the UE demultiplexes the processed synchronization signals for synchronization with the base station. --> In an aspect, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH signal, and the second group of the synchronization signals includes a BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a BRS. In an aspect, the first group of the synchronization signals may further include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, and another PBCH signal, and the second group of the synchronization signals may further include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, and another BRS. In such an aspect, the another PBCH signal may be a duplicate of the PBCH signal and the another BRS may be a duplicate of the BRS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the synchronization signals may include a PBCH, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the PBCH and the second group of the synchronization signals may include a BRS, a PSS, an SSS, and a repetition of the BRS. At 3408, the UE may perform additional features, as discussed infra. FIG. 35 is a flowchart 3500 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 3400 of FIG. 34. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3408, the UE continues from the flowchart 3400 of FIG. 34. At 3502, the UE receives one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission, where each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission includes a repetition of the first transmission, where the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission are received within a first synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the first synchronization subframe, the UE may receive, from the base station, the first group of processed synchronization signals multiple times. At 3504, the UE receives one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, where the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are received within a second synchronization subframe. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, during the second synchronization subframe, the UE may receive, from the base station, the second group of processed synchronization signals multiple times. --> In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission may be received using at least one of a plurality of beams at a plurality of directions and the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission may be received using at least one of the plurality of beams at the plurality of directions. For example, as discussed supra, a UE may be able to utilize beamforming to utilize multiple beams in multiple directions, and thus the UE may be able to receive transmissions from the base station using at least one of the multiple beams transmitted in the direction of the UE. In an aspect, the first group of the processed synchronization signals may include a first one of the processed second synchronization signals and the second group of the processed synchronization signals may include a second one of the processed second synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18, the first group of the processed synchronization signals may include a PBCH, and the second group of the processed synchronization signals may include a BRS. FIG. 36 is a flowchart 3600 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3602, the UE receives a transmission of at least one of a plurality of first synchronization signals. At 3604, the UE receives at least one repeat transmission of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals. In an aspect, the transmission (e.g., at 3602) and the at least one repeat transmission (e.g., at 3604) are received in a same synchronization signal block. In an aspect, the plurality of first synchronization signals may include at least one of a BRS, an ESS, a PSS, an SSS, or a PBCH signal. In an aspect, the at least one of plurality of first synchronization signals may include at least one of a PBCH signal or a DMRS for a PBCH signal. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 16, the UE may receive a PBCH 1672 and a repetition of the PBCH 1678 in the same synchronization block. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 16, the UE may receive a BRS and a PBCH signal during the first synchronization subframe, and as discussed supra, the PBCH signal may be frequency-division multiplexed with a BRS and/or an ESS. At 3606, the UE may receive at least one of plurality of second synchronization signals, wherein the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals and the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals are received in a same synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the plurality of second --> synchronization signals may include at least one of a PSS or an SSS. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 16, the UE may receive a PSS and an SSS in addition to receiving a PBCH and a repetition of the PBCH. In an aspect, the UE may receive at least one of plurality of second synchronization signals by: receiving the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals after receiving the transmission of the at least one/ of the plurality of first synchronization signals and before receiving the at least one repeat transmission of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 16, a PSS and an SSS are received after receiving the PBCH and before receiving the repetition of the PBCH. At 3608, the UE may estimate a carrier frequency offset based on the received transmission of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals and the received at least one repeat transmission of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may estimate a carrier frequency offset (CFO) based on the synchronization signal and the repeated synchronization signal before the UE decodes the synchronization signal. In an aspect, the carrier frequency offset may be estimated based on a difference between the reception of the transmission of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals and the reception of the at least one repeat transmission of the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals, the difference being at least one of a time difference or a frequency difference. For example, as discussed supra, because the PBCH and the repeated PBCH should be identical, the UE may estimate a CFO based on a difference (e.g., in frequency and/or time) between a received transmission of PBCH and a received repeated transmission of the PBCH. In an aspect, the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals may include a PSS, where the carrier frequency offset may be estimated further based on the PSS. For example, as discussed supra, when the UE receives the PSS, the UE may make a coarse estimation of the CFO based on the received PSS and an expected transmission of the PSS, and may refine the estimation of the CFO based on the coarse estimation and a difference between the PBCH signal and the repeated PBCH signal. At 3610, the UE may correct a carrier frequency of the UE based on the carrier frequency offset. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may correct the carrier --> frequency of the UE over time based on the estimated CFO (e.g., so as to minimize the CFO). At 3612, the UE perform additional features described infra. FIG. 37 is a flowchart 3700 of a method of wireless communication, expanding from the flowchart 3600 of FIG. 36. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3612, the UE may continue from the flowchart 3600 of FIG. 36. At 3702, the UE may detect an SSS based on the estimated carrier frequency offset, where the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals includes the SSS. For example, as discussed supra, at 2006, the UE may detect an SSS using the estimated CFO, and may receive the detected SSS. At 3704, the UE may decode the at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals based on the estimated carrier frequency offset. For example, as discussed supra, at 2008, the UE may decode a PBCH using the estimated CFO. At 3706, in an aspect where the plurality of first synchronization signals and the plurality of second synchronization signals are processed by time-division multiplexing the plurality of first synchronization signals and the plurality of second synchronization signals, the UE may demultiplex the plurality of first synchronization signals and the plurality of second synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, when the UE receives the processed synchronization signals from the base station, the UE demultiplexes the processed synchronization signals for synchronization with the base station. At 3708, in an aspect where the transmission of the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals is received via a first receive beam and the repeat transmission of the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals is received via a second receive beam, the UE may select a receive beam from the first receive beam and the second receive beam based on a reception condition of the transmission of the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals and a reception condition of the repeated transmission of the at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals. For example, as discussed supra, at 2010, the UE may select a receive beam out of multiple receive beams based on the two BPCH received at the UE. For example, as discussed supra, when the UE --> receives the two PBCHs in two OFDM symbols, the UE may use different receive beams to receive the two PBCHs respectively. FIG. 38 is a flowchart 3800 of a method of wireless communication. The method may be performed by a UE (e.g., the UE 802, the apparatus 3902/3902\\'). At 3801, the UE may receive system information including an indication of at least one of the first numerology, the second numerology, or a tone spacing scheme used for wireless communication by the base station. In an aspect, the system information may be included in at least one of a MIB or a SIB. For example, as discussed supra, a numerology and/or tone spacing may be declared in the system information (e.g., in a MIB and/or a SIB) transmitted from the base station to the UE. In an aspect, the second numerology may indicate a numerology of at least one of RMSI or OSI. For example, as discussed supra, the numerology for the data signal may indicate the numerology of RMSI and/or OSI. At 3802, the UE receives one or more synchronization signals from a base station based on a first numerology. For example, as discussed supra, because the numerology information is provided to the UE (e.g., via the system information), when the UE receives a synchronization signal, the UE may consider a corresponding numerology to receive the synchronization signal. In an aspect, the one or more synchronization signals may include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, or a PBCH signal. For example, as discussed supra, the synchronization signal may include one or more of a PSS, an SSS, a BRS, an ESS, and a PBCH. At 3804, the UE receives one or more data signals from the base station based on a second numerology. For example, as discussed supra, when the UE receives a data signal, the UE may consider a corresponding numerology to receive the data signal. In an aspect, the second numerology may be different from the first numerology. In an aspect, the one or more data signals may include one or more PDSCH signals. For example, as discussed supra, the data signal may include one or more of a PDSCH and a PUSCH. In an aspect, the first numerology of the at least one synchronization signal defines a first tone spacing and the second numerology of the at least one data signal defines a second tone spacing. For example, as discussed supra, the numerology for --> a synchronization signal may be tone spacing different from tone spacing for a data signal. In such an aspect, the at least one synchronization signal is received at a first periodicity based on the first tone spacing and the at least one data signal is received at a second periodicity based on the second tone spacing. For example, as discussed supra, a duration of a transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a processed synchronization signal may be a function of a numerology and/or tone spacing for the processed synchronization signal. For example, as discussed supra, a duration of a transmission (e.g., periodicity) of a data signal may be a function of a numerology and/or tone spacing for the data signal. In such an aspect, the first tone spacing for the at least one synchronization signal is greater than the second spacing for the at least one data signal. For example, as discussed supra, the numerology (e.g., tone spacing) for the synchronization signal may be greater than the numerology (e.g., tone spacing) for the data signal. In an aspect, the UE may receive one or more synchronization signals by receiving a plurality of synchronization signals that have been processed, the plurality of synchronization signals including a plurality of first synchronization signals of different types and a plurality of second synchronization signals of different types. In such an aspect, the UE may receive the plurality of synchronization signals by: receiving a first transmission by receiving a first group of the plurality of synchronization signals, and receiving one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission includes a repetition of the first transmission, where the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the first transmission are received within a first synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the first transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions are received using at least one of different beams of the UE in different directions. For example, as discussed supra, after the base station 804 processes a group of synchronization signals, the UE 802 may receive the group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the group of the processed synchronization signals within a synchronization subframe (e.g., at 814-820 of FIG. 8). For example, as discussed supra, the UE may have multiple antenna subarrays and may be capable of beamforming, and thus may utilize one or more beams to receive the transmissions from the base station. In such an aspect, the UE may receive the --> plurality of synchronization signals further by: receiving a second transmission by receiving a second group of the plurality of synchronization signals, receiving one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission, wherein each of the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission includes a repetition of the second transmission, where the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are received within a second synchronization subframe. In an aspect, the second transmission and the one or more repeat transmissions of the second transmission are received using at least one of a plurality of beams of the UE in different directions, respectively. For example, as discussed supra, after the base station 804 processes a second group of synchronization signals, the UE 802 may receive the second group of the processed synchronization signals and repeat the transmission of the second group of the processed synchronization signals within the subsequent synchronization subframe. For example, as discussed supra, the UE may have multiple antenna subarrays and may be capable of beamforming, and thus may utilize one or more beams to receive the transmissions from the base station. At 3806, the UE may demultiplex the processed plurality of synchronization signals by performing time-division demultiplexing of at least one of the plurality of first synchronization signals and at least one of the plurality of second synchronization signals. In such an aspect, the UE may demultiplex the processed plurality of synchronization signals by: performing the time-division demultiplexing of at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals and at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals, performing at least one of frequency-division demultiplexing of the at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals or time-division demultiplexing of the at least two of the plurality of first synchronization signals, and performing at least one of frequency-division demultiplexing of at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals or time-division demultiplexing of at least two of the plurality of second synchronization signals. In an aspect, the UE may demultiplex (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) first multiplexed synchronization signals that were multiplexed (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) within the first synchronization signals and demultiplex (e.g., time-division or frequency-division) second multiplexed synchronization signals that were multiplexed (e.g., time-division --> or frequency-division) within the second synchronization signals to produce a resulting synchronization signal, and may subsequently perform time-division demultiplex the resulting synchronization signals.

The present invention relates to a laundry machine, and, more particularly, to a laundry machine capable of generating steam, to use the steam, and a control method of the same. A laundry machine may include a washer and a dryer. Here, the washer means an apparatus for separating contaminants from laundry, using wash water and detergent. That is, the laundry machine may separate contaminants from laundry by utilizing chemical action of detergent dissolved in wash water and mechanical action of wash water or mechanical action by driving of an inner tub (drum). The dryer means an apparatus for drying laundry. That is, the dryer dries laundry by supplying hot dry air to the laundry. Another laundry machine may include a combination washer and dryer capable of not only performing drying, but also performing washing. Similarly to the above-mentioned laundry machine, the combination washer and dryer may perform washing, using wash water and detergent. In this regard, the combination washer and dryer may be referred to as a laundry machine. One type of laundry machine is a horizontal-axis laundry machine in which a drum receiving laundry is driven with respect to a horizontal axis, to perform washing. In such a horizontal-axis laundry machine, mechanical energy is applied to laundry through driving of the drum, to separate contaminants from the laundry. The washing environment of the horizontal-axis laundry machine may be an environment in which laundry is partially immersed in water. Accordingly, most mechanical actions to wash laundry in the horizontal-axis laundry machine may include friction among clothes of laundry, friction between the laundry and the drum, impact force applied to the laundry, etc. Of course, in this case, washing may be carried out through chemical action of a detergent. Another type of laundry machine is a vertical-axis laundry machine in which an inner tub receiving laundry rotates with respect to a vertical axis, or a pulsator installed in the inner tub rotates, to perform washing. In such a vertical-axis laundry machine, mechanical energy is applied to laundry through driving of the inner tub or pulsator, to separate contaminants from the laundry, as in the above-mentioned horizontal-axis laundry machine. --> The washing environment of the vertical-axis laundry machine may be an environment in which laundry is partially immersed in water. Accordingly, most mechanical actions to wash laundry in the vertical-axis laundry machine may include friction between the laundry and the flow of water, impact force applied to the laundry, etc. Of course, in this case, washing may also be carried out through chemical action of a detergent. Thus, the vertical-axis laundry machine and horizontal-axis laundry machine have a great difference in terms of amount of wash water used in washing and washing mechanism. In spite of such a difference, both the horizontal-axis laundry machine and the vertical-axis laundry machine may include a washing heater for heating wash water. Heating of wash water may be carried out for promoted activation of detergent to obtain enhanced washing effects and for enhanced sterilization effects at high temperature. Therefore, generally, the temperature of wash water may be increased to a predetermined temperature through driving of the washing heater. That is, generally, washing effects may be enhanced through an increase in the temperature of wash water. Recently, a laundry machine, in which steam is supplied to create a high-temperature washing environment while reducing energy consumption, has come into wide use. In such a laundry machine, steam is generated and supplied to a drum in order to create a hot and humid washing environment for enhanced washing effects. This laundry machine may obtain enhanced washing effects through a steam washing course using steam in addition to water washing. In such a laundry machine, however, there are increased costs and control difficulty because a separate steam generator should be employed. In detail, the steam generator includes a steam heater for generating steam, separately from a general washing heater. For this reason, use of a laundry machine, which employs a washing heater while excluding a separate steam generator, has been proposed. Steam may be generated through heating of water to the boiling point of water or above. In this regard, a laundry machine equipped with a separate steam generator may be a laundry machine in which water is heated to the boiling point thereof or above, to generate steam, and the generated steam is used for washing. Steam may also be generated through heating of water to a temperature lower than the boiling point of water. In this regard, a laundry machine, which employs a washing heater while excluding a separate steam generator, may be a laundry machine in which water is heated to a temperature lower than the boiling point thereof, to generate steam, and the generated steam is used for washing. In the laundry machine, which generates steam, using the washing heater, steam is generated within the tub. That is, steam may be generated in a relatively large space. Therefore, generally, steam may be generated through heating of water to a temperature lower than the boiling point of water by the washing heater. In the laundry machine, which generates steam, using the washing heater, steam is mainly used during water washing due to structural restriction. --> Steam may be used to obtain enhanced washing effects in water washing. Steam may also be used to refresh laundry. In particular, in a laundry machine such as a dryer, a refreshing course may be provided. In a dryer, steam may be mainly used to refresh laundry, for example, to remove creases or odor, rather than for enhancement in washing effects. Hereinafter, a conventional general laundry machine will be described with reference to FIGs. 1 and 2. The laundry machine may include a cabinet 10 to form an appearance of the laundry machine, and a tub 20 installed in the cabinet 10. The tub 20 may be configured to receive wash water. The tub 20 may be provided with a washing heater 60 for heating wash water. Due to gravity, the water level of wash water supplied to the tub 20 may be gradually increased from a bottom surface of the tub 20. Accordingly, the washing heater 60 may be arranged at a lowest portion of the tub 20. A drum 30 is disposed within the tub 20. The drum 30 is rotatably installed in the tub 20. Laundry is received in the drum 30. The drum 30 may be driven by a driving unit 71-72. Through driving of the drum 30, washing may be carried out. The driving unit may include a motor 71. Driving of the motor 71 may be directly converted into driving of the drum 30. Such a structure is generally referred to as a \"direct connection type motor structure. Of course, rotation of the motor 71 may be converted into driving of the drum 30 via a pulley 72, as illustrated in the drawings. Due to driving of the drum 30, etc., vibration may be transmitted to the tub 20. To this end, the tub 20 may be supported with respect to the cabinet 10 by dampers 21. A door 40 may be provided in front of the drum 30. A gasket 50 may be provided in rear of the door 40. The gasket 50 may be connected to the cabinet 10 and tub 20. Accordingly, the front side of the tub 20 may be elastically supported with respect to the cabinet 10 by the gasket 50. For execution of washing, wash water should first be supplied. To this end, a water supply unit 80 is provided to supply wash water from an external water supply source to the laundry machine. The water supply unit 80 may include a water supply valve 81, which is selectively opened or closed, and a wash water passage 82. The wash water passage 82 may be connected with a detergent box 83 for receiving detergent. The detergent box 83 may be supplied to a supply passage 84. Wash water and detergent supplied through the supply passage 84 may be mainly supplied to the interior of the drum 30. As illustrated in FIG. 2, a plurality of through holes 31 is provided at the drum 30. The interior of the drum 30 may communicate with the interior of the tub 20 through the through holes 31. A heater mounting recess 22 may be formed at a lower portion of the tub 20. The heater mounting recess 22 may be provided at a lowermost portion of the tub 20. Since the --> washing heater 60 is mounted in the heater mounting recess 22, it may remain immersed in water even at a lowest level of wash water. The heater mounting recess 22 may be connected to a drainage passage 23. Accordingly, wash water in the tub 20 may be drained outwards of the laundry machine via the heater mounting recess 22 and drainage passage 23. As mentioned above, generally, generation of steam using the washing heater 60 requires water washing as a precondition thereof. This may also be seen from the structural features of the laundry machine illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2. In detail, wash water and detergent for washing are supplied to the interior of the drum 30. That is, when supply of water is executed, the supplied wash water and detergent wet laundry received in the drum 30. The wash water and detergent is partially collected in the tub 20, starting from the bottom of the tub 20. As supply of water continues, the level of wash water is gradually increased. Supply of water continues until the level of wash water reaches a predetermined water level. In particular, the predetermined water level in the horizontal-axis laundry machine is relatively lower than that of the vertical-axis laundry machine. In other words, in the horizontal-axis laundry machine, washing is carried out in an environment in which laundry is partially immersed in water. Therefore, the structure in which wash water and detergent are directly supplied to laundry may be general. In order to generate steam, using the washing heater, accordingly, there may be a problem in that water should always be supplied through the interior of the drum. That is, there may be a problem in that supply of wash water inevitably involves wetting of at least a portion of the laundry received in the drum. For this reason, there is difficulty in variously utilizing steam because utilization of steam requires water washing as a precondition thereof. In detail, there are many problems in utilizing steam only for refreshing. This is because laundry to be refreshed has a very high moisture content due to the above-mentioned structural problem and, as such, a separate drying procedure should be needed. Meanwhile, the level of refreshing in conventional laundry machines is about a level of simply supplying moisture to laundry, using steam. That is, refreshing in conventional laundry machines only involves tumbling in the drum in order to uniformly supply steam to all laundry. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a scheme capable of deriving optimal relations among the steam generation and supply structure, the temperature of steam, and driving of the drum, to enable execution of more effective refreshing. In addition, it is necessary to provide a laundry machine capable of performing refreshing while reducing a subsequent drying procedure as much as possible. That is, it is necessary to provide a laundry machine capable of realizing a refreshing performance enabling wearing of clothes just after refreshing thereof without requiring drying through a dryer or natural drying. --> Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a laundry machine and a control method of the same that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. An object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of remarkably enhancing crease removal effects and odor removal effects, and a control method of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of achieving enhanced safety and enhanced reliability, and a control method of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of realizing a refreshing performance enabling wearing of garments just after refreshing thereof without requiring a separate drying procedure, and a control method of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of achieving effective generation and supply of steam, using a washing heater, and a control method of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of achieving refreshing using steam while obtaining enhanced washing effects, using steam, and a control method of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of more effectively achieving forced cooling through supply of wash water, and a control method of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of supplying wash water at an optimal position in accordance with a selected course, through control of varying the supply position of wash water in accordance with a selected course, and a control method of the same. A further object of the present invention is to provide a laundry machine capable of executing a wash water heating operation, separately from a steam operation, using a washing heater, and a control method of the same. Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings. To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method for controlling a laundry machine to execute a refreshing course for removal or reduction of creases formed at laundry through supply of steam to the laundry includes a steam water supply operation of supplying wash water from an external water supply source to an interior of a tub up to a water level for generation of steam while preventing the wash water to pass through a drum, a --> steaming operation of heating the wash water by driving a washing heater provided at the tub, thereby generating steam from the wash water at the water level for generation steam, and a refreshing operation of refreshing the laundry. The washing heater is preferably arranged at the bottom of the tub, i.e. outside or inside thereof. The method may further include a course selection operation of selecting one of a plurality of washing courses, wherein the steam water supply operation is performed, when the refreshing course is selected in the course selection operation. Moreover, the refreshing operation may include alternately executing, after execution of the steaming operation, a tumbling driving operation to tumble the laundry within the drum in accordance with rotation of the drum and a spin driving operation to rotate the laundry within the drum in close contact with an inner surface of the drum, together with the drum, in accordance with high-speed rotation of the drum. Preferably, the tumbling driving operation and the spin driving operation are repeatedly executed. Tumbling driving may be defined as driving of the drum causing laundry within the drum to fall in accordance with rotation of the drum. Spin driving may be defined as driving of the drum causing laundry within the drum to rotate together with the drum while in close contact with an inner surface of the drum in accordance with high-speed rotation of the drum. In this regard, the rotation speed of the drum during spin driving should be higher than the rotation speed of the drum during tumbling driving. The water level for generation of steam may be a predetermined water level lower than a bottom of the drum. The water level for generation of steam may be a water level at which the washing heater is completely immersed in the wash water. The plurality of washing courses may include a water washing course of executing water washing by supplying the wash water up to a water level for main washing. The water washing course may include a heating executable course in which a heating operation is executed after supply of the wash water up to the water level for main washing, and a heating-excluding course in which the heating operation is excluded. The water level for main washing may be always higher than the water level for generation of steam, irrespective of an amount of laundry and selection of the water washing course. The supply of the wash water up to the water level for main washing may be executed such that the wash water is supplied from the external water supply source to an interior of the drum via a detergent box, thereby preferably wetting the laundry. That is, the wash water and detergent may be supplied to the laundry received in the drum, through the supply of the wash water. The supply of wash water up to the water level for generation of steam may be executed via a passage formed between the tub and the drum or a rear water supply port provided at a rear top portion of the tub. The passage may be formed along the inner rear surface of the tub. That is, the supplied wash water may be prevented from coming into contact with the laundry received in the drum. Preferably, fresh water is used for the steam water supply --> operation, so that the steam is generated using fresh water, i.e. without detergent, during the steaming operation. The driving of the washing heater in the steaming operation may be continuously executed for a variable time. An allowable maximum value of the variable time may be predetermined, taking into consideration a capacity of the washing heater and an amount of the wash water at the water level for generation of steam. The steaming operation may include a temperature control operation of continuously driving the washing heater until a heating temperature of the washing heater reaches a predetermined temperature. In addition, the steaming operation may include a time control operation of continuously driving the washing heater for a predetermined time after completion of the temperature control operation. The predetermined time of the time control operation may be an allowable maximum value. That is, the predetermined time may be an allowable maximum time. Accordingly, as the time taken for the temperature control operation increases, the time taken for the time control operation may be decreased because the allowable maximum value of the steaming operation is predetermined. The predetermined temperature in the temperature control operation may be approximately 93 to approximately 97°C. In detail, the predetermined temperature may be approximately 95°C. The refreshing operation may be executed for a predetermined time. In the refreshing operation, a drum driving cycle including the tumbling driving operation and the spin driving operation may be repeated multiple times, wherein the tumbling driving operation and the spin driving operation are alternately executed. A time taken for the tumbling driving operation may be 10 times or more as long as a time taken for the spin driving operation. A drainage operation may be executed after completion of the refreshing operation, to complete the refreshing course. Meanwhile, a water re-supply operation may be selectively executed between the refreshing operation and the drainage operation. That is, the water re-supply operation may be executed in accordance with a temperature of the wash water and/or of the interior of the drum when the refreshing operation is completed. The water level for re-supply of water may be higher than the water level for generation of steam. However, the water level for re-supply of water may be a water level at which the wash water does not come into contact with the laundry. Accordingly, the water level for re-supply of water may be predetermined to be lower than the bottom of the drum. The water re-supply operation may be an operation of forcibly cooling an interior of the laundry machine, in particular the interior of the tub, by supplying water, preferably cold or fresh water. Accordingly, a tumbling driving operation may be executed after completion of the supply of water up to the water level for re-supply of water, to promote cooling. Preferably, the water re-supply operation is performed using the water supply path of the steam water supply, e.g. a passage formed between the tub and the drum or a rear water supply port --> provided at a rear top portion of the tub. By these means, it is prevented that the laundry in the drum becomes wet. In another aspect of the present invention, a laundry machine is provided, including a tub, a drum rotatably installed in the tub to receive laundry, a washing heater provided at the tub to heat wash water, and a controller configured to perform a method according to any one of the above described examples. The washing heater is preferably arranged at the bottom of the tub, i.e. outside or inside thereof. In addition, the laundry machine may include a course selector for selecting one of a plurality of washing courses, including a refreshing course. Preferably, the laundry machine includes further a first wash water passage for supplying the wash water from an external water supply source to the drum via a detergent box and a second wash water passage for supplying the wash water from the external water supply source to an interior of the tub while preventing the wash water from passing through the drum, wherein the controller is configured for selectively opening the first wash water passage or the second wash water passage in accordance with a course selected through the course selector. The laundry machine may further include a first water supply valve for opening or closing the first wash water passage, and a second water supply valve for opening or closing the second wash water passage. The first water supply valve and the second water supply valve may be separate from each other. In other words, the first and second wash water passages may supply wash water to different positions, respectively. Of course, the first and second wash water passages may supply wash water from the same external water supply source. The second wash water passage may be a passage formed between the tub and the drum, to supply wash water to the tub. That is, the wash water may be supplied to the tub via a space between the tub and the drum. In detail, the wash water may be supplied from outside of the drum to a lower portion of the tub along an inner surface of the tub. The laundry machine may further include a rear water supply port provided at a rear top portion of the tub and connected to the second wash water passage. The second wash water passage may include the rear water supply port. Accordingly, it may be possible to achieve effective cooling during falling of the wash water in the tub. In more detail, the rear water supply port may be formed to allow the wash water to be supplied from an outside of the drum to a lower portion of the tub along an inner rear surface of the tub. Accordingly, an increased heat transfer area is provided to achieve more effective cooling. The plurality of washing courses may include a washing course in which a steaming operation is executed, as a steam course, and a washing course in which execution of the steaming operation is excluded, as a steam-excluding course. The controller may execute a control operation to supply the wash water to the interior of the tub via the first water supply valve when the steam-excluding course is selected. --> The controller may execute a control operation to supply the wash water to the interior of the tub via the second water supply valve when the steam course is selected. The steam-excluding course may include a main washing operation for executing water washing by the wash water. The steam course may include a steam washing course including a steaming operation and a main washing operation for executing water washing by the wash water, and a refreshing course including a steaming operation while excluding the main washing operation, to refresh the laundry by steam. The controller may execute a control operation to supply the wash water to the interior of the tub via the second water supply valve when the refreshing course is selected. The controller may execute a control operation to supply the wash water to an interior of the drum via the first water supply valve, for execution of the steaming operation of the steam washing course. The controller may execute a control operation to supply the wash water to the interior of the tub via the second water supply valve, for execution of the steaming operation of the refreshing course. That is, it may be possible to change the wash water supply passage in accordance with the selected course. The steaming operation may be an operation of supplying steam to an interior of the drum by driving the washing heater at a predetermined water level for generation of steam lower than a bottom of the drum. That is, the steaming operation may be an operation of driving the washing heater while preventing the laundry in the drum from coming into contact with the wash water under the condition that the laundry does not contact the wash water. The predetermined water level for generation of steam may be a water level at which the washing heater is completely immersed in the wash water. The driving of the washing heater in the steaming operation may be continuously executed for a variable time, and an allowable maximum value of the variable time may be predetermined, taking into consideration a capacity of the washing heater and an amount of the wash water at the water level for generation of steam. The steaming operation may include a temperature control operation of continuously driving the washing heater until a heating temperature of the washing heater reaches a predetermined temperature, and a time control operation of continuously driving the washing heater for a predetermined time after completion of the temperature control operation. The predetermined temperature in the temperature control operation may be 93 to 97°C. In detail, the predetermined temperature may be 95°C. The refreshing course may include the steaming operation, which is executed to supply steam to the interior of the drum by heating the wash water after completion of the supply of the wash water, and a refreshing operation of refreshing the laundry by driving the drum after completion of the steaming operation. The controller may control the steaming operation and the refreshing operation to be sequentially executed when the refreshing course is selected. --> The controller may control the refreshing operation to be is executed for a predetermined time. The controller may control the refreshing operation to alternately execute a tumbling driving operation of the drum and a spin driving operation of the drum. The controller may control the refreshing operation to repeat multiple times a drum driving cycle including the tumbling driving operation and the spin driving operation. The time taken for the tumbling driving operation may be 10 times or more as long as the time taken for the spin driving operation. The controller may execute a control operation to supply the wash water to the interior of the tub up to a predetermined water level for re-supply of water via the second water supply valve after completion of the refreshing operation. The water level for re-supply of water may be higher than a water level for generation of steam, but lower than a bottom of the drum. The controller may control the drum to execute the tumbling driving operation in the steaming operation. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate embodiment(s) of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principle of the invention. In the drawings:FIG. 1 is a lateral sectional view schematically illustrating a general laundry machine;FIG. 2 is a front sectional view schematically illustrating the laundry machine illustrated in FIG. 1;FIG. 3 is a lateral sectional view schematically illustrating a laundry machine according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 4 is a front sectional view schematically illustrating the laundry machine illustrated in FIG. 3;FIG. 5 is a block diagram schematically illustrating a configuration of the laundry machine according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 6 is a front view illustrating an example of a control panel included in the laundry machine in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 7 illustrates a flowchart of a control operation in the laundry machine according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and a graph depicting a temperature variation during the control operation; -->FIG. 8 is a graph depicting a temperature variation in a steaming operation illustrated in FIG. 7; andFIG. 9 is a graph depicting a temperature variation in a cooling operation selectively executable after completion of a refreshing operation illustrated in FIG. 7. Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. First, an example of a laundry machine applicable to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 3 and 4. The laundry machine illustrated in FIGs. 3 and 4 may be a horizontal-axis laundry machine. Of course, the laundry machine according to the embodiment of the present invention and a control method of the same are not limited to the horizontal-axis laundry machine. As illustrated in FIGs. 3 and 4, the basic configurations of the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment may be similar to those of a conventional general laundry machine. Basically, configurations such as a cabinet 100, a tub 200, a drum 300, a door 400, a gasket 500, a washing heater 600, and a driving unit 710-720 may be similar to those of a conventional general laundry machine. Suspension structures such as dampers 210 in the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment may be similar to those of the conventional general laundry machine. However, the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment may include a first wash water passage 150 and a second wash water passage 160. The first wash water passage 150 and second wash water passage 160 may be separate from each other. Both the first wash water passage 150 and the second wash water passage 160 may receive wash water from an external water supply source. The laundry machine may receive wash water from the external water supply source via an external hose connected to the external water supply source. Thus, wash water supplied from an outside of the laundry machine may reach desired positions within the laundry machine via different passages, respectively. In detail, the first wash water passage 150 and second wash water passage 160 may communicate with the tub 200. Accordingly, although wash water is supplied through different supply passages, the wash water may be collected in the tub 200, starting from a bottom of the tub 200. Due to the different supply passages, however, there may be differences as follows. The first wash water passage 150 may be provided to supply wash water from the external water supply source to the drum 300 via a detergent box 153. For such a function, the first wash water passage 150 may include a first water supply valve 151. The first wash water passage 150 may also include a first water supply hose 152 to communicate the first water supply valve 151 and detergent box 153. --> The first water supply valve 151 is selectively opened or closed. Accordingly, when the first water supply valve 151 is opened, the first wash water passage 150 may be opened. Thus, when the first water supply valve 151 is opened, wash water is supplied via the first wash water passage 150. In addition, the first wash water passage 150 may include a first supply hose 154 to communicate the detergent box 153 and the interior of the drum 300. The first supply hose 154 may extend through the gasket 500. Accordingly, wash water may be directly supplied to the interior of the drum 300 via the first water supply hose 154. The first water supply hose 154 is arranged above the door 400 and, as such, wash water falls onto laundry received in a lower portion of the drum 300. Accordingly, wash water supplied via the first supply hose 154 wets at least a portion of the laundry received in the drum 300. The wash water supplied to the interior of the drum 300 may be introduced into a lower portion of the tub 200 via through holes 310 of the drum 300 illustrated in FIG. 4. In this regard, the first wash water passage 150 may be a passage for supplying wash water from the external water supply source to the drum 300, in detail, an upper portion of the drum 300, via the detergent box 153. Of course, the first wash water passage 150 may include a passage for supplying wash water from the interior of the drum 300 to the lower portion of the tub 200 via the through holes 310 of the drum 300. By virtue of provision of the first wash water passage 150, laundry is wetted from an early stage of water supply. Accordingly, it may be possible to expect reduced washing time and enhanced washing effects through rapid wetting of laundry. In the illustrated embodiment, the second wash water passage 160 may be separate from the first wash water passage 150. That is, it is desirable to provide parallel wash water passages which supply wash water through different paths, respectively. In detail, the second wash water passage 160 may be provided to directly supply wash water from the external water supply source to the interior of the tub 200 while preventing the wash water from passing through the drum 300. The second wash water passage 160 may include a second water supply valve 161. The second water supply valve 161 is selectively openable. Accordingly, when the second water supply valve 161 is opened, the second wash water passage 160 may be opened to supply wash water. The second water supply valve 161 may be separate from the first water supply valve 151. Accordingly, the first and second water supply valves 151 and 161 may be controlled independently of each other. This means that the valves 151 and 161 are simultaneously openable or only a selected one of the valves 151 and 161 is openable. That is, the first and second wash water passages 150 and 160 may be selectively opened. In addition, the second wash water passage 160 may include a second supply hose 162. The second supply hose 162 is connected to the second water supply valve 161 and, as such, supplies wash water to the tub 200 when the second water supply valve 161 is opened. --> In this case, the position at which the second supply hose 162 communicates with the tub 200 is different from the position at which the first supply hose 154 communicates with the tub 200 or drum 300. In other words, the first and second supply hoses 154 and 162 may have different wash water supply positions, respectively. In detail, the second supply hose 162 may directly communicate with the tub 200 in order to prevent wash water from entering the drum 200. In other words, wash water supplied through the second supply hose 162 may be prevented from coming into contact with laundry received in the drum 300. In more detail, the second supply hose 162 may communicate with a rear water supply port 163. Accordingly, the second wash water passage 160 may supply wash water to the interior of the tub 200 through the rear water supply port 163. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the rear water supply port 163 may be disposed at a rear portion of the tub 200. In detail, the rear water supply port 163 may be disposed at a top side of the rear portion of the tub 200. Preferably, the rear water supply port 163 is disposed in rear of the rearmost portion of the drum 300. Accordingly, wash water supplied through the rear water supply port 163 is introduced into the tub 200 at the outside of the drum 300. The introduced wash water may be collected in the lower portion of the tub 200. In accordance with the position of the rear water supply port 163, wash water supplied via the second wash water passage 160 may be supplied to the interior of the tub 200 without wetting laundry. Meanwhile, the position and shape of the rear water supply port 163 may be determined such that the rear water supply port 163 corresponds to a rear surface of the tub 200. In other words, wash water supplied through the rear water supply port 163 may be directed to the rear surface of the tub 200. To this end, the rear water supply port 163 may be arranged at a position just above the rear surface of the tub 200. The rear water supply port 163 may also be formed to be inclined. That is, the rear water supply port 163 may be inclined rearwards. Accordingly, wash water supplied through the rear water supply port 163 may flow to the lower portion of the tub 200 along the rear surface of the tub 200. The rear water supply port 163 may be disposed at a more rear position of the tub 200, as compared to the position illustrated in FIG. 3. The rear water supply port 163 may also be further inclined, as compared to the case illustrated in FIG. 3. The position and wash water supply direction of the rear water supply port 163 may be determined to achieve various goals and effects in addition to the above-described goals and effects. This will be described later. FIG. 5 is a block diagram of the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment. Operation of the laundry machine is controlled through a controller 805. Generally, the controller 805 may be provided within a control panel 800 (FIG. 6). Generally, --> the control panel 800 is disposed on a top of the laundry machine, to allow the user to manipulate the control panel 800 and display of status. The controller 805 may control operation of the laundry machine, based on signals input through various user interfaces (UIs), for example, a course selector 810 or the like provided at the control panel 800. That is, the laundry machine is operated in accordance with a course selected through the course selector 810 and an option selected through an option selector that is not shown. Information as to the selected course and option, time information, and current status information may be displayed on a display not shown, under control of the controller 805. The controller 805 may control driving of the first and second water supply valves 151 and 161. Through control of the first and second water supply valves 151 and 161, it may be possible to control an amount of wash water supplied. The controller 805 may also control a wash water supply position such that the wash water supply position is varied, through control of the water supply valves 151 and 161 as described above. The controller 805 may control driving of the washing heater 600. Accordingly, the washing heater 600 may be driven such that the temperature of wash water reaches a desire temperature. The washing heater 600 may also be prevented from overheating. The controller 805 may control driving of a motor 710 of the driving unit. Through control of the motor 710, it may be possible to appropriately determine a time when the motor 710 is to be driven and a driving pattern of the motor 710 (for example, tumbling driving of the drum 300, spin driving of the drum 300, spin-drying driving of the drum 300, etc.). Tumbling driving means driving of the drum causing laundry within the drum to tumble in accordance with rotation of the drum. Spin driving means driving of the drum causing laundry within the drum to rotate together with the drum while in close contact with an inner surface of the drum in accordance with high-speed rotation of the drum. In this regard, the rotation speed of the drum during spin driving should be higher than the rotation speed of the drum during tumbling driving. Spin-drying driving is similar to spin driving. However, the rotation speed of the drum during spin-drying driving may be higher than the rotation speed of the drum during spin driving. This is because spin-drying driving is driving for removal of moisture through centrifugal force. The controller 805 may control driving of a drainage pump 620. Accordingly, drainage may be executed at a time when drainage is needed. The controller 805 is always signal-connected with a water level sensor 630 and a temperature sensor 610. Accordingly, the controller 805 may receive desired water level information and temperature information at a specific time through the sensors 610 and 630. Based on water level information supplied from the water level sensor 630, the controller 805 may control driving of the water supply valves 151 and 161. Accordingly, it may be possible to supply wash water to a desired water level. --> Based on temperature information supplied from the temperature sensor 610, the controller 805 may control driving of the washing heater 600. Accordingly, it may be possible to heat wash water to a desired temperature. FIG. 5 illustrates an example of the control panel 800 in the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment. The laundry machine may selectively execute a plurality of washing courses in order to wash various articles of laundry. The laundry machine may also selectively execute a plurality of washing courses in order to provide functionality in addition to washing of laundry. In this regard, it is desirable to enable the user to easily select a desired one of the plural washing courses. The laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment may include the washing heater 600 which heats wash water, as described above. The washing heater 600 may also generate steam. The steam may be supplied to the interior of the drum 300. In detail, steam generated at the lower portion of the tub may be supplied to the interior of the drum 300 through the through holes 310 of the drum 300. Steam generation through the washing heater 600 involves additional energy consumption. Therefore, it is desirable to enable the user to clearly check whether or not steam is used. To this end, in the illustrated embodiment, various courses associated with steam may be provided. The course selector 810 may be provided for selection of a specific course from among plural courses. The plural courses may include heating executable courses 820. That is, the plural courses may include courses in which the washing heater 600 may be driven. When the user selects one of the heating executable courses 820, the selected course may be executed. In this case, the controller 805 may control the laundry machine to execute the selected course in accordance with a predetermined program. For example, the heating executable courses 820 may include a normal course. When the user only selects the normal course, the normal course which includes washing, rinsing and spin-drying may be executed in accordance with a predetermined program. Of course, the user may additionally select use of the washing heater 600 while selecting one of the heating executable courses 820. That is, the user may select driving of the washing heater 600 in accordance with a given option for the selected course. In the heating executable courses 820, driving of the washing heater 600 may be automatically or selectively executed in order to increase the temperature of wash water. That is, it may be possible to increase the temperature of wash water in order to achieve an enhancement in washing efficiency. Generally, the heating executable courses 820 may involve an option for selection of wash water temperature. Prior to description of the heating executable courses 820, an example of the normal course will be described. --> The normal course may be a course in which the temperature of wash water is automatically set to 40°C. In this case, when cold water or tap water is supplied from the external water supply source, an operation of automatically heating wash water to 40°C may be executed. On the other hand, when 60°C is selected as a wash water temperature in accordance with a given option for selection of wash water temperature, an operation of heating wash water to 60°C may be executed. Of course, \"cold water\" or \"tap water\" may be selected as a wash water temperature in accordance with the given option for selection of wash water temperature. In this case, wash water heating may be dispensed with. In this regard, each of the heating executable courses 820 may be a course in which the temperature of wash water is variable to achieve enhanced washing effects. Of course, in this course, the user may select whether or not the washing heater 600 is to be driven. The plural courses may also include heating-excluding courses 840. That is, the plural courses may include courses in which driving of the washing heater 600 is excluded or limitedly executed. Each of the heating-excluding courses 840 may be a course in which driving of the washing heater 600 is excluded. That is, the heating-excluding courses 840 may be programmed such that they do not include heating. The heating-excluding courses 840 may include washing courses for functional wear or wool wear having possibility of damage by heat, a quick course for rapid washing, etc. If necessary, accordingly, the washing heater 600 may be automatically set to heat wash water to a temperature of 30 to 40°C. Alternatively, a desired wash water temperature may be selectable within a range of up to 30 or 40°C. Of course, driving of the washing heater 600 may be completely excluded. The plural courses may include steam courses 830. That is, the plural courses may include courses in which steam is automatically used. In other words, each of the steam courses 830 may be programmed to include steaming. In FIG. 6, an allergy care course 831 and a refreshing course 832 are illustrated as examples of the steam courses 830. The user may select a desired specific course by rotating a rotary knob 815. When a specific course is selected, the laundry machine automatically executes the selected course, and then completes execution of the selected course. Lamps 816 may be provided at the rotary knob 815. The lamps 816 may correspond to respective courses. Accordingly, the user may easily recognize which course is selected, in accordance with sequential turning on/off of the lamps 816 during rotation of the rotary knob 815. The plural courses may be intuitionally distinguished from one another by colors printed on the control panel 800 to indicate respective courses. For example, the steam courses 830 are printed by red color in order to enable the user to intuitionally recognize courses of using hot steam. Here, it may be seen that the plural washing courses in the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment are distinguishable from one another in accordance with whether or not the washing heater 600 drives. --> The laundry machine may include heating-excluding courses in which driving of the washing heater 600 is completely excluded. The laundry machine may also include courses in which driving of the washing heater 600 is selectable or is automatically included. The courses including driving of the washing heater 600 may be classified into a heating executable course and a steam course. Hereinafter, differences between the heating executable course and the steam course will be described. Heating in the heating executable course may be similar to steaming in the steam course. That is, the washing heater 600 may be driven in both the heating operation and the steaming operation. However, there may be a fundamental difference between the heating operation and the steaming operation in terms of the level of wash water during driving of the washing heater 600. As illustrated in FIG. 4, various water levels may be determined in association with relations among the tub 200, drum 300, and washing heater 600. In accordance with a variation in water level, there may a water level A, at which the washing heater 600 is completely immersed in water, a water level B, at which wash water reaches the bottom of the drum 300, and a water level C, at which wash water reaches the interior of the drum 300. In a horizontal-axis laundry machine, washing is carried out through driving of a drum. In spite of such a system, the drum may be driven under the condition that laundry is in a state of being wetted by wash water. In washing, that is, washing of using water, accordingly, wash water may be stored to reach the interior of the drum. Therefore, a preferred water level for washing is at least the water level C. Meanwhile, when the amount of laundry to be washed is increased, an increased amount of wash water may be supplied. To this end, an increased amount of wash water is supplied for an increased amount of laundry. This means that the level of wash water is increased to be higher than the water level C when the amount of laundry is large. Basically, a laundry amount determining operation is executed for execution of washing in the laundry machine. That is, when a desired course is selected, and execution of the selected course is begun, the laundry amount determining operation is executed. In accordance with a laundry amount determined in the laundry amount determining operation, the level of wash water for water washing (main washing) is determined. Accordingly, supply of water is executed until the level of wash water supplied reaches the determined wash water level. If necessary, the washing heater 600 is driven after completion of supply of water, to increase the temperature of wash water. Generally, main washing is executed through driving of the drum 300 after completion of supply of water or completion of heating. In this regard, heating may be an operation of driving the washing heater under the condition that wash water is stored to reach the interior of the drum. Thus, at least a portion of laundry is immersed in heated wash water. In the illustrated embodiment, however, steaming may be distinguished from heating. --> In detail, the level of wash water during steaming may be lower than the level of wash water during heating. As shown in FIG. 4, the level of wash water during steaming may be lower than at least the water level B, but higher than the water level A. In other words, the level of wash water may be set to prevent laundry received in the drum 300 from coming into contact with heated wash water. The level of wash water may also be set to prevent the washing heater 600 from being exposed to the air. The level of wash water during steaming may be determined to be always lower than the level of wash water during main washing which is water washing. That is, the level of wash water during steaming may be determined between the water level A and the water level B, whereas the level of wash water during main washing may be determined to be always higher than the water level B. Due to the above-described differences between the heating operation and the steaming operation, the above-described plural courses may be classified as follows. First, courses or washing courses, in which steaming is executed, may be referred to as \"steam courses\". On the other hand, courses or washing courses, in which execution of steaming is excluded, are referred to as \"steam-excluding courses\". Such steam-excluding courses may be courses in which heating may be included, but steaming is not executed. The steam courses may include a steam washing course and a refreshing course. An example of the steam washing course may be the allergy care course 831 illustrated in FIG. 6, and another example of the steam washing course may be the refreshing course 832 illustrated in FIG. 6. The steam washing course may be a course including a steaming operation, and a main washing operation in which water washing is executed using wash water. That is, the steam washing course may be a course in which steaming and main washing are executed during execution of the course. In the steaming operation, the washing heater 600 may be driven at a water level for steaming. On the other hand, in the main washing operation, the washing heater 600 may be driven at a water level for main washing. That is, a heating operation may be executed for execution of the main washing operation. Of course, the differences between the steaming operation and the heating operation may be associated with levels of wash water, as described above. The steam courses may include courses including the steaming operation, but excluding the main washing operation. That is, the steam courses may be courses in which the main washing operation at the water level for main washing is not executed during course execution. In detail, such a steam course may include a refreshing course for refreshing laundry, using steam. Hereinafter, the refreshing course will be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 7 and 8. --> One of the plural courses may be selected through the course selector 810, as illustrated in FIG. 6. When the refreshing course is selected through the course selector 810, the selected refreshing course may be executed. For execution of the refreshing course, wash water may be drained out of the tub 200 for a predetermined time t0 (S1). For execution of the steaming operation, wash water may then be supplied for a predetermined time t1. This operation may be a steam water supply operation S2. As described above, supply of water in the steam water supply operation S2 is executed such that the level of water supplied reaches the water level for steaming. Accordingly, the steam water supply operation may be executed until the water level sensor 630 senses the water level for steaming. In this regard, the predetermined time t1 in the steam water supply operation S2 may be an allowable water supply period. That is, the predetermined time t1 may be an allowable maximum water supply period. This time may be determined, taking into consideration a variation in water pressure. The predetermined time t1 may be set to about 2 minutes. This means that supply of water may be executed for a maximum of 2 minutes. Typically, supply of water may be ended before 2 minutes elapse because the water level sensor 630 may senses the water level for steaming before 2 minutes elapse. Supply of water in the steam water supply operation S2 may be executed in a manner different from that of a general washing course. That is, supply of water for execution of the steaming operation in the refreshing course may be executed in a manner different from that of a steam-excluding course. In detail, when the refreshing course 832 is selected, the controller 805 controls the second water supply valve 161 to be opened in order to introduce wash water into the tub 200 via the second wash water passage 160. In other words, the controller 805 may control supply of water such that wash water is prevented from coming into contact with laundry received in the drum 300. The refreshing course may be a course of refreshing dry laundry without execution of water washing. For example, the refreshing course may be a course of refreshing laundry such as a shirt that was worn once by the wearer, without water-washing the laundry. In this regard, the refreshing course may be a course of relatively easily and rapidly refreshing laundry through removal of creases or odor without execution of water washing. Accordingly, it is preferred that laundry be prevented from being wetted by wash water, for execution of the refreshing course. This is because, once laundry is wetted by wash water, it is necessary to execute drying for an additional time. That is, wearing of laundry is possible only after drying through the dryer or natural drying is carried out. As described above, the refreshing course may be provided to enable wearing of a shirt refreshed just after execution of the refreshing course. Therefore, supply of water through the second wash water passage 160 is very preferable. Meanwhile, the second wash water passage 160 may be a passage irrespective of the detergent box 152. That is, clean water such as tap water may always be supplied --> through the second wash water passage 160. On the other hand, the first wash water passage 160 is connected with the detergent box 153. For this reason, sediments of detergent or the like may remain in the first wash water passage 160. However, such detergent sediments do not cause any serious problems in association with water washing. This is because water washing is carried out, using a relatively great amount of wash water. However, the second wash water passage 160 is a passage irrespective of detergent sediments or the like. Accordingly, detergent sediments or the like do not enter the interior of the tub 200. Theoretically, it is difficult to completely prevent laundry from coming into contact with wash water introduced through the second wash water passage 160. This is because it is impossible to avoid a possibility that small droplets formed in accordance with striking of wash water against the tub 200 may be introduced into the drum 300. In this case, it is very undesirable that detergent sediments are introduced into laundry during the refreshing course in which no water washing is carried out. This is because detergent sediments may remain in laundry after completion of the refreshing course. In this regard, it is preferred that supply of wash water in the refreshing course be executed through the second wash water passage 160, as described above. In this case, it may be possible to supply only clean water to the interior of the tub 200. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent contaminants such as detergent sediments from being transferred to laundry. After completion of the steam water supply operation S2, a steaming operation S3 may be executed. The steaming operation S3 may be an operation of generating steam by driving the washing heater 600. Alternatively, the steaming operation S3 may be an operation of simultaneously executing generation of steam and transferring of steam to the interior of the drum 300. Driving of the washing heater 600 during the steaming operation S3 may be intermittently executed. In spite of such a driving method, a great amount of energy may be consumed for increase in water temperature and vaporization of water. For this reason, it is preferred that the washing heater 600 be driven in a continuous manner. In accordance with such a driving method, steam may be continuously generated during the steaming operation S3. The time taken for the steaming operation S3 is variable. This is because the time taken for the steaming operation S3 may be varied in accordance with the amount of wash water for generation of steam (associated with water level), the capacity of the washing heater 600, and a predetermined heating temperature of the washing heater 600. In addition, overheating of the washing heater 600 in the steaming operation S3 should be prevented. This means that it is necessary to prevent the washing heater 600 from being driven in a state of being exposed to the air. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, therefore, it is preferred that the driving time of the washing heater 600 during the steaming operation S3 be controlled to be --> variable. That is, it is preferred that the period of time that driving of the washing heater 600 is continuously executed from a time when driving of the washing heater 600 starts until driving of the washing heater 600 is stopped be controlled to be variable. In addition, an allowable maximum value of the period may be predetermined. Such an allowable maximum value may be determined, taking into consideration the capacity of the washing heater 600 and the amount of wash water at the water level for steaming. The steaming operation S3 may include a temperature control operation and a time control operation in association with control of the washing heater 600. The sum of a time t2 taken for the temperature control operation and a time t3 taken for the time control operation may be the time taken for the steaming operation S3, namely, a time t4. Here, the time control operation may be an operation of continuously driving the washing heater 600 for a predetermined time. The time t3 may be the predetermined time. Of course, the time t3 of the time control operation may be predetermined to be an allowable maximum time. That is, the time t3 may be predetermined to be an allowable maximum time while being variable in accordance with the time t2 of the temperature control operation. Accordingly, the time t4 taken for the steaming operation S3 may be substantially variable by the times t2 and t3. In detail, the temperature control operation may be an operation of continuously driving the washing heater 600 until the heating temperature of wash water reaches a target temperature, namely, a predetermined temperature T1. In this regard, the target temperature may be a fixed value, but the time taken for the heating temperature to reach the target temperature may be variable. This is because there are causes such as a deviation in the amount of wash water, a deviation in the voltage applied to the washing heater 600, a deviation in the initial temperature of wash water, and differences of articles of laundry. The predetermined temperature T1 may be set to be lower than the boiling point of water, namely, 100°C. This is because the time control operation follows after the temperature control operation, that is, the washing heater 600 is continuously driven in the time control operation, even after the temperature control operation. In other words, the predetermined temperature T1 is set as described above in order to secure a sufficient steam generation time while preventing wash water from overheating. After driving of the washing heater 600 starts in the steaming operation S3, the temperature of wash water is gradually increased, as shown in FIG. 8. When the temperature of wash water approaches the boiling point of water, namely, 100°C, the temperature increase gradient of wash water may be varied. After experiments of operating the laundry machine in a heating environment, it may be seen that the temperature increase gradient of wash water becomes gentle at about 95°C. This may be because a large portion of heat to heat wash water is used as heat of vaporization. In this regard, in the illustrated embodiment, the predetermined temperature T1 in the temperature control operation may be set to be about 95°C. The temperature control --> operation may be continued until the temperature sensor 610 senses the predetermined temperature T1. Time t2 may be the time required until the predetermined temperature T1 is reached. Accordingly, the time t2 may be a variable time. The predetermined temperature T1 may be sensed by the temperature sensor 610 which is disposed in the vicinity of the washing heater 600. That is, the temperature sensor 610 may be provided to sense a temperature at a position very close to an area where heat is generated. In FIG. 4, an example of the temperature sensor 610 disposed at one side of the washing heater 600 is illustrated. Thus, the temperature sensor 610 does not directly sense the temperature of the washing heater 600, but very rapidly senses the temperature of wash water heated through the washing heater 600. Meanwhile, the time control operation follows the temperature control operation. Of course, the washing heater 600 is continuously driven during the time control operation. In other words, driving of the washing heater 600 is maintained for the predetermined time t3 after completion of the temperature control operation. Of course, the predetermined time t3 may be a fixed value. The predetermined time t3 may be appropriately set, taking into consideration overheating of wash water, overheating of the washing heater 600, amount of wash water, and steam generation time. The inventors of the present invention experimentally found that it is desirable to predetermine the time taken for the time control operation to be about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When the time control operation is executed as described above, it may be seen that the maximum heating temperature of wash water is controlled to be lower than 103°C. Of course, the time taken for the time control operation may be varied in accordance with a relation thereof with the predetermined temperature T1 in the temperature control operation. This is because it is desirable to increase the time t2 when the predetermined temperature T1 decreases. Thus, it may be possible to secure prevention of overheating and a sufficient steam generation time as the steaming operation S3 is executed through the temperature control operation and the time control operation successively following the temperature control operation. Hereinafter, examples of the temperature control operation and time control operation in the steaming operation will be described. The temperature control operation may be continued for 7 minutes. Here, \"7 minutes\" may be a variable time. Subsequently, the time control operation may be continued for a fixed time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Accordingly, the steaming operation may be executed for 9 minutes and 30 seconds. Meanwhile, the temperature control operation may be continued for 8 minutes. Subsequently, the time control operation may be continued. In this case, however, the time control operation may be continued for 2 minutes, in place of the fixed time of 2 minutes --> and 30 seconds. Thus, the time control operation may be variably controlled in accordance with the temperature control operation. An allowable maximum value of the time control operation may be fixed. For example, the allowable maximum value may be 2 minutes and 30 seconds. In accordance with determination of the allowable maximum value of the time taken for the time control operation, the allowable maximum value of the execution period of the steaming operation may be determined. For example, the allowable maximum value of the execution period of the steaming operation may be 10 minutes. When the temperature control operation is executed only for 7 minutes, as described above, the steaming operation may be executed for 9 minutes and 30 seconds. Since temperature control and time control are sequentially executed, it may be possible to prevent the washing heater or wash water from overheating. It may also be possible to secure a sufficient steam generation time. Since the allowable maximum value of the time taken for the time control period is predetermined, the allowable maximum value of the execution period of the steaming operation is also predetermined. Accordingly, there is no occasion that the time taken for the steaming operation is no longer increased. For example, if time control is not executed, there may be a possibility that the time taken for the steaming operation may be excessively increased, in a particular environment. For example, extreme environments such as an excessive amount of wash water, a very low initial temperature of wash water, a very low external voltage, a very cold external environment, and an excessive amount of laundry may be assumed. In such cases, the time taken for the steaming operation may be 10 minutes or more. As described above, the refreshing course may be a course for refreshing laundry for a short period of time. Accordingly, it is preferred that the time taken for the refreshing course be predetermined. In this regard, it is undesirable to execute the refreshing course for a time longer than the predetermined time, even in an extreme environment. For this reason, the allowable maximum value of the time taken for the steaming operation may be predetermined. The time taken for the time control operation may be varied, taking into consideration the allowable maximum value of the time taken for the steaming operation and the time taken for the temperature control operation. Of course, the allowable maximum value of the time taken for the time control operation may also be predetermined. If necessary, the time control operation may be dispensed with. Alternatively, the time control operation may be executed only for a time much shorter than the allowable maximum value of the time taken for the time control operation. Of course, the time control operation may be executed for the allowable maximum time thereof. It may be possible to control the drum 300 to execute tumbling driving during the steaming operation S3. That is, a stirring operation may be executed during the steaming operation S3. Such tumbling driving is adapted to effectively transfer steam to laundry. The tumbling driving may also be adapted to create a steam environment within the tub 200 as --> well as the drum 300. Accordingly, steam may be uniformly spread within the tub 200 and drum 300 without being locally concentrated, through tumbling driving. Similarly, steam is supplied throughout the entirety of laundry without being locally supplied to the laundry. Through the above-described steaming operation S3, laundry is exposed to a hot and humid environment. Odor molecules may be removed from the laundry in the hot and humid environment. Of course, in the steaming operation, it may be possible to supply moisture throughout a very wide area, as compared to a conventional case in which the same amount of water as that of the steaming operation S3 is used. This is because moisture in a steam state is supplied to laundry, in place of moisture in a water state. When the steaming operation S3 is completed, a refreshing operation S4 may be executed. That is, the steaming operation S3 and refreshing operation S4 may be sequentially executed. The controller 820 may control the steaming operation S3 and refreshing operation S4 to be sequentially executed, in accordance with a predetermined program. The refreshing operation S4 may be an operation of increasing the content of moisture in laundry, using steam. The refreshing operation S4 may also be an operation of uniformly supplying steam to laundry in a steam environment. The refreshing operation S4 may also be an operation of gradually lowering the internal temperature of the drum 300 or tub 200. In this regard, the drum 300 may also be driven during the refreshing operation S4, similarly to the steaming operation S3. Generally, \"tumbling driving\" means driving of a drum to raise laundry from a bottom of the drum, and then to drop the raised laundry. For this reason, the laundry may include folded portions. Of course, the laundry may have variable exposure surfaces because it tumbles in accordance with the tumbling driving. Supply of steam in the steaming operation S3 is not carried out in such a manner that steam is directly injected onto laundry under high pressure. Supply of steam in the steaming operation S3 is carried out in such a manner that laundry absorbs steam in a steam environment. Therefore, it is desirable to uniformly and maximally expose surfaces of laundry to a steam environment. In addition, for removal of creases, applying certain tension to laundry may be more effective. In other words, it may be possible to more effectively remove creases by supplying moisture to a creased laundry portion while tensing the creased laundry portion at opposite sides thereof. Therefore, drum driving in the refreshing operation S4 may include spin driving in order to achieve more effective and uniform supply of steam to laundry and more effective removal of creases from laundry. In spin driving, the revolutions per minute (RPM) of the drum 300 is relatively high, as compared to that in tumbling driving. That is, \"spin driving\" means a driving operation to rotate the drum 300 such that laundry overcomes gravity. Generally, such spin driving may be realized at about 80 rpm. --> In spin driving, laundry is rotated integrally with the drum 300 while in contact with an inner surface of the drum 300. Accordingly, tension may be applied to laundry in accordance with rotation of the drum 300. Laundry may also come into contact with steam present in the tub 200 through the through holes 310. It may also be possible to more effectively supply steam to laundry by generating flow of steam in the drum 300. That is, it may be possible to increase the steam contact area of laundry because the laundry may spread through spin driving. It may also be possible to obtain enhanced crease removal effects because tension may be applied to laundry. Meanwhile, the inventors found that it is more preferable for spin driving to be executed together with tumbling driving during the refreshing operation S4. This may be because tumbling driving is driving to tumble laundry or to change exposure surfaces of the laundry through stirring of the laundry. That is, this may be because tumbling driving is driving to expose the entire outer surface of laundry to a steam environment, rather than to expose particular portions of laundry to the steam environment. In this regard, it may be assumed that only the tumbling driving is executed during the refreshing operation S4. However, it may be possible to achieve an increase in moisture content and an enhancement in crease removal effects, through the spin driving. In other words, it may be possible to achieve an increase in moisture content, that is, to enable laundry to absorb a relatively large amount of moisture, in accordance with addition of spin driving, as compared to the case in which only the tumbling driving is executed. It was also be found that an enhancement in crease removal effects is achieved. Therefore, an operation of executing tumbling driving of the drum 300 and an operation of executing spin driving of the drum 300 may be alternately executed during the refreshing operation S4. That is, a tumbling driving operation is executed for a predetermined period, and a spin driving operation is then executed for a predetermined period. Each of the tumbling driving operation and spin driving operation may be executed multiple times. In other words, a drum driving cycle including the tumbling driving operation and spin driving operation may be repeated multiple times. In order to easily realize various control of drum driving as described above, the driving unit to drive the drum 300 may be a direct connection type driving unit different from that of FIG. 4. Such a direct connection type driving unit is well known in the technical field and, as such, no detailed description thereof will be given. In detail, the time taken for the tumbling driving operation may be longer than the time taken for the spin driving operation. For example, the total time taken for repeated tumbling driving operations may be about 10 times as long as the total time taken for repeated spin driving operations. This is because, if the spin driving time is excessively increased, crease formation possibility may be increased. Therefore, the refreshing operation S4 may be executed, starting from tumbling driving and ending by tumbling driving. Spin driving may be executed for a relatively short time between successive tumbling driving operations. --> As described above, spin driving may be executed multiple times. In this case, spin driving may exhibit different characteristics in accordance with different execution points of time. First, spin driving executed in an early stage of the refreshing operation S4 may be adapted to achieve an increase in moisture content. Of course, such an increase in moisture content may be to achieve removal of creases. This is because spin driving in an early stage of the refreshing operation S4 is executed in a hot and humid environment. However, the temperature and humidity of the environment are inevitably gradually lowered as the refreshing operation S4 proceeds toward a last stage thereof. This is because the interior of the tub 200 is incompletely sealed from the outside thereof. Accordingly, the amount of moisture in the interiors of the drum 300 and tub 200 is gradually reduced as the refreshing operation S4 proceeds toward a last stage thereof. This means a reduction in the moisture content of laundry. In this regard, spin driving in stages toward the last stage of the refreshing operation S4 may be executed to reduce the moisture content of laundry. That is, this spin driving may be spin driving to remove moisture from laundry through generation of flow of air in the drum 300 or tub 200. Thus, a subsequent drying procedure following the refreshing course may be substantially dispensed with. In other words, laundry such as a shirt may be worn by the wearer just after completion of the refreshing course. In this regard, the refreshing course may be very effectively utilized. Meanwhile, the refreshing course 832 is considerably different from a general water washing course in terms of characteristics. That is, the refreshing course 832 is a course to rapidly refresh dry laundry under the condition that the laundry is not wetted by water. Accordingly, spin driving in the refreshing operation S4 may be very effective in terms of reliability of the laundry machine or user satisfaction. That is, in accordance with repetition of tumbling driving included in general washing and spin driving, the user may visually and intuitionally recognize execution of the refreshing operation S4. This is because the user may see laundry moving within the drum 300 from the outside of the drum 300 through a transparent window provided at the door 400. The refreshing operation S4 may be executed for a predetermined time t5. As described above, the total time of the refreshing course may be predetermined. This is because the user may desire to wear laundry just after completion of the refreshing course. Therefore, the time taken for the refreshing course S4 may be predetermined. Based on the predetermined time t5, it may be possible to determine the number of tumbling driving operations, the number of spin driving operations, the time taken for each driving operation, the time difference between each tumbling driving operation and each spin driving operation, etc. As the refreshing operation S4 proceeds, the internal temperature of the drum 300 or the temperature of wash water may be gradually decreased. Accordingly, when the refreshing operation S4 is completed, the refreshing course may be ended (S6) after execution of --> a drainage operation S5. The time taken for the drainage operation S5, t6, may also be predetermined. As described above, the refreshing course may be completed without additional supply of water after completion of the refreshing operation S4. The refreshing operation S4 may be executed for about 15 to 20 minutes. In this case, accordingly, the internal temperature of the drum 300 or the temperature of laundry after the refreshing course may be high. For this reason, when the door 400 is opened after completion of the refreshing course, the user may have inconvenience due to hot air. To this end, a cooling procedure for decreasing the internal temperature of the tub 200 or drum 300 may be needed. Of course, the cooling procedure needs not be executed all of the time. This is because the cooling procedure may not be needed in accordance with the amount of laundry or the maximum temperature of wash water. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, a cooling operation may be executed after completion of the refreshing operation S4, if necessary. That is, a cooling operation may be executed between the refreshing operation S4 and the drainage operation S5. The cooling operation may be an operation of forcibly decreasing the temperature of wash water and the temperature of the internal atmosphere of the laundry machine, using cold water. In detail, it may be possible to sense the temperature of wash water through the temperature sensor 610 after completion of the refreshing operation S4. Since the temperature sensor 610 may be disposed in the vicinity of the washing heater 600, it may be possible to sense a maximum internal temperature of the tub 200. Accordingly, it may be possible to execute an operation of comparing the temperature sensed through the temperature sensor 610 with a predetermined temperature T2. The predetermined temperature T2 may be, for example, about 60°C. As described above, the drainage operation S5 may be executed without execution of a separate cooling procedure when the sensed temperature is lower than the predetermined temperature T2. However, when the sensed temperature is equal to or higher than the predetermined temperature T2, the cooling operation may be executed. As shown in FIG. 9, a temperature sensing operation may be executed for a very short time. During the temperature sensing operation, there may be no variation in water level. The water level during the temperature sensing operation may be substantially lower than the water level for steaming. That is, the water level during the temperature sensing operation may be lower than the water level A. If the sensed temperature is higher than the predetermined temperature T2, cold water may be supplied from the external water supply source. That is, re-supply of water may be executed. In this case, cold water may be supplied via the second wash water passage, similarly to supply of water in the steaming operation. Re-supply of water may be carried out until the level of water re-supplied reaches the water level for steaming. For example, the level --> of re-supplied water may be the water level A which is an example of the water level for steaming. However, the level of re-supplied water may be higher than the water level for steaming in order to achieve more rapid cooling. That is, water may be additionally supplied up to the water level B approaching the lowermost portion or bottom surface of the drum 300. That is, the level of re-supplied water may be higher than the water level for steaming. The level of re-supplied water may also be lower than the water level for main washing. Accordingly, laundry is not wetted by wash water even when water is supplied up to the above-described re-supply water level. This is because wash water is not re-heated. On the other hand, the water level for steaming may be lower than the water level B, taking into consideration generation of air bubbles due to heating, because wash water is heated at the water level for steaming. By virtue of the difference between the water level for steaming and the re-supply water level, an increased amount of wash water may be supplied without wetting laundry. Accordingly, it may be possible to more rapidly decrease the internal temperature of the drum 300. In this connection, it may be seen that the position and water supply direction of the rear water supply port 163 are important, as described above. Re-supply of water or additional supply or water may be executed to rapidly decrease the internal temperatures of the tub 200 and drum 300, rather than to simply decrease the temperature of wash water collected in the lower portion of the tub 200. Therefore, it is preferred that the heat exchange area of additionally-supplied wash water be maximized. The rear water supply port 163 may be arranged to allow wash water supplied through the rear water supply port 163 to flow downwardly along the rear surface of the tub 200. In this case, the wash water supplied through the rear water supply port 163 may exchange heat with a large area of the tub 200. Accordingly, more rapid cooling may be achieved. After completion of the additional supply of water, tumbling driving may be executed for, for example, 2 to 3 minutes. Through the tumbling driving, flow of air is generated within the tub 200 and drum 300 and, as such, rapid cooling may be achieved. After completion of the tumbling driving, drainage may be executed. Thus, execution of the refreshing course may be completed. Heretofore, the refreshing course as an example of the steam courses has been described in detail. Hereinafter, the steam washing course will be described in detail. In FIG. 6, the allergy care course 831 is illustrated as an example of the steam washing courses. The allergy care course 831 may be a course in which a steaming operation is executed together with water washing. Supply of water for main washing, in which water washing is executed, that is, supply of water up to the water level for main washing, may be executed via the first wash water passage 150. In other words, it may be possible to enhance --> washing effects by wetting laundry by wash water and detergent from an early stage of the course. The steaming operation in the allergy care course 831 may be executed before main washing. For the steaming operation, supply of water up to the water level for steaming may be executed. Additional supply of water may be executed after completion of the steaming operation. Here, the additional supply of water may mean supply of water up to the water level for main washing. Preferably, supply of water for execution of the steaming operation in the allergy care course 831 is preferably executed via the second wash water passage 160, similarly to the refreshing course. However, it is more preferred that supply of water be executed via the first wash water passage 150 because the allergy care course 831 includes water washing. That is, wash water and detergent may be supplied up to the water level for steaming via the first wash water passage 150. Accordingly, wash water and detergent may be supplied from an initial stage of the allergy care course 831. Thereafter, a steaming operation may be executed to supply steam to laundry. In the allergy care course 831, the steaming operation may be executed under the condition that at least a portion of laundry has been wetted by wash water and detergent. Accordingly, soaking of laundry and contaminants and soaking of detergent may be more actively achieved through the steaming operation. Therefore, it is preferred that wash water always be supplied via the first wash water passage 150 in the steam washing course in which water washing is executed. On the other hand, it is preferred that wash water always be supplied via the second wash water passage 160 in the steam course in which water washing is excluded. In other words, the passage to supply wash water may be changed in accordance with whether water washing is executed, even in a course in which steaming is executed. In addition, the passage to supply wash water may be changed in accordance with selected courses, even when wash water is supplied for execution of the same steaming operation in the selected courses. In detail, supply of water for main washing using water may be executed via the first wash water passage 150, irrespective of selected courses. On the other hand, supply of water for execution of steaming may always be executed via the second wash water passage 160. Alternatively, supply of water for execution of steaming may be executed via the first wash water passage in accordance with selected courses. For example, in a course including a water washing operation and a steaming operation, supply of water for execution of the steaming operation may be executed via the first wash water passage 150. In a course including a steaming operation while excluding a water washing operation, however, supply of water for execution of the steaming operation may be executed via the second wash water passage 160. Accordingly, the controller 805 of the laundry machine according to the illustrated embodiment may perform a control operation to selectively open the first wash water --> passage 150 or the second wash water passage 160 in accordance with a course selected through the course selector 810. Selection of a specific passage may be executed by selectively opening the water supply valve 151 or 161. In detail, in a water washing course (including a steam washing course, a heating executable course, and a heating-excluding course) in which wash water is supplied up to the water level for main washing, for execution of water washing, supply of wash water may be controlled to be always executed via the first wash water passage 150. In this case, accordingly, wash water and detergent are supplied to laundry from an initial stage of the course and, as such, rapid wetting of laundry and enhanced washing effects may be expected. Meanwhile, the water level for main washing may always be higher than the water level for steaming, irrespective of selected courses and amount of laundry. As apparent from the above description, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of remarkably enhancing crease removal effects and odor removal effects, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of achieving enhanced safety and enhance reliability, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of realizing a refreshing performance enabling wearing of garments just after refreshing thereof without requiring a separate drying procedure, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of achieving effective generation and supply of steam, using a washing heater, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of achieving refreshing, using steam, while obtaining enhanced washing effects, using steam, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of more effectively achieving forced cooling through supply of wash water, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of supplying wash water at an optimal position in accordance with a selected course, through control of varying the supply position of wash water in accordance with a selected course, and a control method of the same. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be possible to provide a laundry machine capable of executing a wash water heating operation, separately from a steam operation, using a washing heater, and a control method of the same. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations --> of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. --> 1.

The organic contaminants can be removed from the surface 20 via techniques, such as, plasma treatment. In order to obtain good adhesion of the environmental barrier layer 18 to the surface 20 it can be advantageous to enhance the properties of the surface 20. Referring also to Fig. 3, in an exemplary embodiment the surface 20 can be altered through use of exposure of the surface 20 to at least one of a chemical process or a physical process.

The present disclosure relates to fuel metering systems, such as those used in aviation gas turbine engines. In modern aircraft, un-commanded high engine thrust (UHT) is a concern. It is desirable to rapidly detect and accommodate a UHT event. Engine shut down is a limited option and is only really an option on the ground. In-flight (and in some cases, on the ground as well), if one engine is shut down because of a UHT event, an aircraft can experience gross asymmetric thrust. Therefore, it is preferable to have a system capable of rapidly detecting a UHT threat and subsequently able to maintain and control the fuel flow to the engine, thereby controlling engine thrust. It is an aim of the present disclosure to at least partially address the problems discussed above. According to a first aspect of the disclosure there is provided a fuel metering system for a gas turbine engine, the fuel metering system comprising one or more of: a fuel supply line; a fuel metering valve configured to pass an amount of fuel received from the fuel supply line to the gas turbine engine; an engine control unit configured to control the position of the fuel metering valve according to a demanded fuel flow to the gas turbine engine; a flow sensor configured to provide a measurement of a flow of fuel in the fuel metering system; wherein the engine control unit is further configured to determine a fuel flow to the gas turbine engine based upon the measurement from the flow sensor; and wherein the engine control unit is further configured to identify a loss of fuel flow control by comparing the demanded fuel flow to the determined fuel flow to the gas turbine engine. --> Optionally, the engine control unit is configured to identify a loss of fuel flow control when the fuel flow measured by the flow sensor exceeds the demanded fuel flow by a threshold amount. Optionally, the fuel metering system further comprises: a spill line configured to receive excess fuel from the fuel supply line; and a spill valve provided in the spill line and configured to control the flow of fuel through the spill line.

Optionally, the system is configured such that fuel not passed by the fuel metering valve to the gas turbine engine is received by the spill line as the excess fuel. Optionally, the flow sensor is configured to measure a flow of fuel downstream of the fuel metering valve. Optionally, the flow sensor comprises a passive flow sensing valve configured to directly measure the downstream flow of fuel from the fuel metering valve. --> Optionally, the flow sensor comprises a position sensor configured to determine the position of a valve downstream of the fuel metering valve. Optionally, the flow sensor is configured to measure a flow of fuel upstream of the fuel metering valve. Optionally, the flow sensor is configured to measure the fuel flow in the spill line. According to second aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method of operating a fuel metering system for a gas turbine engine, the method comprising the steps of: controlling supply of fuel to a gas turbine engine according to a demanded fuel flow; taking a measurement of a flow of fuel in the fuel metering system; determining a flow of fuel to the gas turbine engine based upon the measurement; and comparing the demanded fuel flow to the determined fuel flow. Optionally, the method comprises the step of limiting a maximum fuel flow to the gas turbine engine in response to identifying that the determined fuel flow exceeds the demanded fuel flow by more than a threshold amount. Optionally, the step of limiting comprises limiting the closure of a spill valve in a spill line receiving excess fuel from the fuel supply line. Optionally, the step of limiting comprises closing a fuel metering valve controlling the supply of fuel to the gas turbine engine. Optionally, the fuel metering system is a system according to the first aspect described above. According to a third aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a gas turbine engine for an aircraft comprising: an engine core comprising a turbine, a compressor, and a core shaft connecting the turbine to the compressor; a fan located upstream of the engine core, the fan comprising a plurality of fan blades; a gearbox that receives an input from the core shaft and outputs drive to the fan so as to drive the fan at a lower --> rotational speed than the core shaft; and a fuel metering system according to the first aspect described above. Optionally, the turbine is a first turbine, the compressor is a first compressor, and the core shaft is a first core shaft; the engine core further comprises a second turbine, a second compressor, and a second core shaft connecting the second turbine to the second compressor; and the second turbine, second compressor, and second core shaft are arranged to rotate at a higher rotational speed than the first core shaft. As noted elsewhere herein, the present disclosure may relate to a gas turbine engine. Such a gas turbine engine may comprise an engine core comprising a turbine, a combustor, a compressor, and a core shaft connecting the turbine to the compressor. Such a gas turbine engine may comprise a fan (having fan blades) located upstream of the engine core. Arrangements of the present disclosure may be particularly, although not exclusively, beneficial for fans that are driven via a gearbox. Accordingly, the gas turbine engine may comprise a gearbox that receives an input from the core shaft and outputs drive to the fan so as to drive the fan at a lower rotational speed than the core shaft. The input to the gearbox may be directly from the core shaft, or indirectly from the core shaft, for example via a spur shaft and/or gear. The core shaft may rigidly connect the turbine and the compressor, such that the turbine and compressor rotate at the same speed (with the fan rotating at a lower speed). The gas turbine engine as described and/or claimed herein may have any suitable general architecture. For example, the gas turbine engine may have any desired number of shafts that connect turbines and compressors, for example one, two or three shafts. Purely by way of example, the turbine connected to the core shaft may be a first turbine, the compressor connected to the core shaft may be a first compressor, and the core shaft may be a first core shaft. The engine core may further comprise a second turbine, a second compressor, and a second core shaft connecting the second turbine to the second compressor. The second turbine, second compressor, and second core shaft may be arranged to rotate at a higher rotational speed than the first core shaft. --> In such an arrangement, the second compressor may be positioned axially downstream of the first compressor. The second compressor may be arranged to receive (for example directly receive, for example via a generally annular duct) flow from the first compressor. The gearbox may be arranged to be driven by the core shaft that is configured to rotate (for example in use) at the lowest rotational speed (for example the first core shaft in the example above). For example, the gearbox may be arranged to be driven only by the core shaft that is configured to rotate (for example in use) at the lowest rotational speed (for example only be the first core shaft, and not the second core shaft, in the example above). Alternatively, the gearbox may be arranged to be driven by any one or more shafts, for example the first and/or second shafts in the example above. In any gas turbine engine as described and/or claimed herein, a combustor may be provided axially downstream of the fan and compressor(s). For example, the combustor may be directly downstream of (for example at the exit of) the second compressor, where a second compressor is provided. By way of further example, the flow at the exit to the combustor may be provided to the inlet of the second turbine, where a second turbine is provided. The combustor may be provided upstream of the turbine(s). The or each compressor (for example the first compressor and second compressor as described above) may comprise any number of stages, for example multiple stages. Each stage may comprise a row of rotor blades and a row of stator vanes, which may be variable stator vanes (in that their angle of incidence may be variable). The row of rotor blades and the row of stator vanes may be axially offset from each other. The or each turbine (for example the first turbine and second turbine as described above) may comprise any number of stages, for example multiple stages. Each stage may comprise a row of rotor blades and a row of stator vanes. The row of rotor blades and the row of stator vanes may be axially offset from each other. --> Each fan blade may be defined as having a radial span extending from a root (or hub) at a radially inner gas-washed location, or 0% span position, to a tip at a 100% span position. The ratio of the radius of the fan blade at the hub to the radius of the fan blade at the tip may be less than (or on the order of) any of: 0.4, 0.39, 0.38 0.37, 0.36, 0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32, 0.31, 0.3, 0.29, 0.28, 0.27, 0.26, or 0.25. The ratio of the radius of the fan blade at the hub to the radius of the fan blade at the tip may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). These ratios may commonly be referred to as the hub-to-tip ratio. The radius at the hub and the radius at the tip may both be measured at the leading edge (or axially forwardmost) part of the blade. The hub-to-tip ratio refers, of course, to the gas-washed portion of the fan blade, i.e. the portion radially outside any platform. The radius of the fan may be measured between the engine centreline and the tip of a fan blade at its leading edge. The fan diameter (which may simply be twice the radius of the fan) may be greater than (or on the order of) any of: 250 cm (around 100 inches), 260 cm, 270 cm (around 105 inches), 280 cm (around 110 inches), 290 cm (around 115 inches), 300 cm (around 120 inches), 310 cm, 320 cm (around 125 inches), 330 cm (around 130 inches), 340 cm (around 135 inches), 350cm, 360cm (around 140 inches), 370 cm (around 145 inches), 380 (around 150 inches) cm or 390 cm (around 155 inches). In some implementations, the fan diameter may be less than around 130 cm (around 50 inches). The fan diameter may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). The rotational speed of the fan may vary in use. Generally, the rotational speed is lower for fans with a higher diameter. Purely by way of non-limitative example, the rotational speed of the fan at cruise conditions may be less than 2500 rpm, for example less than 2300 rpm. Purely by way of further non-limitative example, the rotational speed of the fan at cruise conditions for an engine having a fan diameter in the range of from 250 cm to 300 cm (for example 250 cm to 280 cm) may be in the range of from 1700 rpm to 2500 rpm, for example in the range of from 1800 rpm to 2300 rpm, for example in the range of from 1900 rpm to 2100 rpm. Purely by way of --> further non-limitative example, the rotational speed of the fan at cruise conditions for an engine having a fan diameter in the range of from 320 cm to 380 cm may be in the range of from 1200 rpm to 2000 rpm, for example in the range of from 1300 rpm to 1800 rpm, for example in the range of from 1400 rpm to 1600 rpm. In use of the gas turbine engine, the fan (with associated fan blades) rotates about a rotational axis. This rotation results in the tip of the fan blade moving with a velocity Utip. The work done by the fan blades 13 on the flow results in an enthalpy rise dH of the flow. A fan tip loading may be defined as dH/Utip2, where dH is the enthalpy rise (for example the 1-D average enthalpy rise) across the fan and Utip is the (translational) velocity of the fan tip, for example at the leading edge of the tip (which may be defined as fan tip radius at leading edge multiplied by angular speed). The fan tip loading at cruise conditions may be greater than (or on the order of) any of: 0.3, 0.31, 0.32, 0.33, 0.34, 0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39 or 0.4 (all units in this paragraph being Jkg-1K-1/(ms-1)2). The fan tip loading may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). Gas turbine engines in accordance with the present disclosure may have any desired bypass ratio, where the bypass ratio is defined as the ratio of the mass flow rate of the flow through the bypass duct to the mass flow rate of the flow through the core at cruise conditions. In some arrangements the bypass ratio may be greater than (or on the order of) any of the following: 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5, or 17. The bypass ratio may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). The bypass duct may be substantially annular. The bypass duct may be radially outside the core engine. The radially outer surface of the bypass duct may be defined by a nacelle and/or a fan case. The overall pressure ratio of a gas turbine engine as described and/or claimed herein may be defined as the ratio of the stagnation pressure upstream of the fan to the stagnation pressure at the exit of the highest pressure compressor (before entry into the combustor). By way of non-limitative example, the overall pressure ratio of a gas turbine engine as described and/or claimed herein at cruise may be greater than --> (or on the order of) any of the following: 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. The overall pressure ratio may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). Specific thrust of an engine may be defined as the net thrust of the engine divided by the total mass flow through the engine. At cruise conditions, the specific thrust of an engine described and/or claimed herein may be less than (or on the order of) any of the following: 110 Nkg-1s, 105 Nkg-1s, 100 Nkg-1s, 95 Nkg-1s, 90 Nkg-1s, 85 Nkg-1s or 80 Nkg-1s. The specific thrust may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). Such engines may be particularly efficient in comparison with conventional gas turbine engines. A gas turbine engine as described and/or claimed herein may have any desired maximum thrust. Purely by way of non-limitative example, a gas turbine as described and/or claimed herein may be capable of producing a maximum thrust of at least (or on the order of) any of the following: 160kN, 170kN, 180kN, 190kN, 200kN, 250kN, 300kN, 350kN, 400kN, 450kN, 500kN, or 550kN. The maximum thrust may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). The thrust referred to above may be the maximum net thrust at standard atmospheric conditions at sea level plus 15 deg C (ambient pressure 101.3kPa, temperature 30 deg C), with the engine static. In use, the temperature of the flow at the entry to the high pressure turbine may be particularly high. This temperature, which may be referred to as TET, may be measured at the exit to the combustor, for example immediately upstream of the first turbine vane, which itself may be referred to as a nozzle guide vane. At cruise, the TET may be at least (or on the order of) any of the following: 1400K, 1450K, 1500K, 1550K, 1600K or 1650K. The TET at cruise may be in an inclusive range bounded by any two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). The maximum TET in use of the engine may be, for example, at least (or on the order of) any of the following: 1700K, 1750K, 1800K, 1850K, 1900K, 1950K or 2000K. The maximum TET may be in an inclusive range bounded by any --> two of the values in the previous sentence (i.e. the values may form upper or lower bounds). The maximum TET may occur, for example, at a high thrust condition, for example at a maximum take-off (MTO) condition. A fan blade and/or aerofoil portion of a fan blade described and/or claimed herein may be manufactured from any suitable material or combination of materials. For example at least a part of the fan blade and/or aerofoil may be manufactured at least in part from a composite, for example a metal matrix composite and/or an organic matrix composite, such as carbon fibre. By way of further example at least a part of the fan blade and/or aerofoil may be manufactured at least in part from a metal, such as a titanium based metal or an aluminium based material (such as an aluminium-lithium alloy) or a steel based material. The fan blade may comprise at least two regions manufactured using different materials. For example, the fan blade may have a protective leading edge, which may be manufactured using a material that is better able to resist impact (for example from birds, ice or other material) than the rest of the blade. Such a leading edge may, for example, be manufactured using titanium or a titanium-based alloy. Thus, purely by way of example, the fan blade may have a carbon-fibre or aluminium based body (such as an aluminium lithium alloy) with a titanium leading edge. A fan as described and/or claimed herein may comprise a central portion, from which the fan blades may extend, for example in a radial direction. The fan blades may be attached to the central portion in any desired manner. For example, each fan blade may comprise a fixture which may engage a corresponding slot in the hub (or disc). Purely by way of example, such a fixture may be in the form of a dovetail that may slot into and/or engage a corresponding slot in the hub/disc in order to fix the fan blade to the hub/disc. By way of further example, the fan blades maybe formed integrally with a central portion. Such an arrangement may be referred to as a blisk or a bling. Any suitable method may be used to manufacture such a blisk or bling. For example, at least a part of the fan blades may be machined from a block and/or at least part of the fan blades may be attached to the hub/disc by welding, such as linear friction welding. --> The gas turbine engines described and/or claimed herein may or may not be provided with a variable area nozzle (VAN). Such a variable area nozzle may allow the exit area of the bypass duct to be varied in use. The general principles of the present disclosure may apply to engines with or without a VAN. The fan of a gas turbine as described and/or claimed herein may have any desired number of fan blades, for example 16, 18, 20, or 22 fan blades. As used herein, cruise conditions may mean cruise conditions of an aircraft to which the gas turbine engine is attached. Such cruise conditions may be conventionally defined as the conditions at mid-cruise, for example the conditions experienced by the aircraft and/or engine at the midpoint (in terms of time and/or distance) between top of climb and start of decent. Purely by way of example, the forward speed at the cruise condition may be any point in the range of from Mach 0.7 to 0.9, for example 0.75 to 0.85, for example 0.76 to 0.84, for example 0.77 to 0.83, for example 0.78 to 0.82, for example 0.79 to 0.81, for example on the order of Mach 0.8, on the order of Mach 0.85 or in the range of from 0.8 to 0.85. Any single speed within these ranges may be the cruise condition. For some aircraft, the cruise conditions may be outside these ranges, for example below Mach 0.7 or above Mach 0.9. Purely by way of example, the cruise conditions may correspond to standard atmospheric conditions at an altitude that is in the range of from 10000m to 15000m, for example in the range of from 10000m to 12000m, for example in the range of from 10400m to 11600m (around 38000 ft), for example in the range of from 10500m to 11500m, for example in the range of from 10600m to 11400m, for example in the range of from 10700m (around 35000 ft) to 11300m, for example in the range of from 10800m to 11200m, for example in the range of from 10900m to 11100m, for example on the order of 11000m. The cruise conditions may correspond to standard atmospheric conditions at any given altitude in these ranges. Purely by way of example, the cruise conditions may correspond to: a forward Mach number of 0.8; a pressure of 23000 Pa; and a temperature of -55 deg C. --> As used anywhere herein, \"cruise\" or \"cruise conditions\" may mean the aerodynamic design point. Such an aerodynamic design point (or ADP) may correspond to the conditions (comprising, for example, one or more of the Mach Number, environmental conditions and thrust requirement) for which the fan is designed to operate. This may mean, for example, the conditions at which the fan (or gas turbine engine) is designed to have optimum efficiency. In use, a gas turbine engine described and/or claimed herein may operate at the cruise conditions defined elsewhere herein. Such cruise conditions may be determined by the cruise conditions (for example the mid-cruise conditions) of an aircraft to which at least one (for example 2 or 4) gas turbine engine may be mounted in order to provide propulsive thrust. The skilled person will appreciate that except where mutually exclusive, a feature or parameter described in relation to any one of the above aspects may be applied to any other aspect. Furthermore, except where mutually exclusive, any feature or parameter described herein may be applied to any aspect and/or combined with any other feature or parameter described herein. Embodiments will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the Figures, in which:Figure 1 is a sectional side view of a gas turbine engine;Figure 2 is a close up sectional side view of an upstream portion of a gas turbine engine;Figure 3 is a partially cut-away view of a gearbox for a gas turbine engine;Figure 4 is a flow diagram of a fuel pumping unit and fuel metering unit;Figure 5 is a flow diagram of engine control loops; -->Figure 6 is a flow diagram of a fuel metering system;Figure 7 is a flow diagram of a fuel metering system;Figure 8 is a flow diagram of a fuel metering system;Figure 9 is a diagram of a fuel system incorporating a splitter and drain unit; andFigure 10 is a diagram of a modification of the fuel system of Figure 9. Figure 1 illustrates a gas turbine engine 10 having a principal rotational axis 9. The engine 10 comprises an air intake 12 and a propulsive fan 23 that generates two airflows: a core airflow A and a bypass airflow B. The gas turbine engine 10 comprises a core 11 that receives the core airflow A. The engine core 11 comprises, in axial flow series, a low pressure compressor 14, a high-pressure compressor 15, combustion equipment 16, a high-pressure turbine 17, a low pressure turbine 19 and a core exhaust nozzle 20. A nacelle 21 surrounds the gas turbine engine 10 and defines a bypass duct 22 and a bypass exhaust nozzle 18. The bypass airflow B flows through the bypass duct 22. The fan 23 is attached to and driven by the low pressure turbine 19 via a shaft 26 and an epicyclic gearbox 30. In use, the core airflow A is accelerated and compressed by the low pressure compressor 14 and directed into the high pressure compressor 15 where further compression takes place. The compressed air exhausted from the high pressure compressor 15 is directed into the combustion equipment 16 where it is mixed with fuel and the mixture is combusted. The resultant hot combustion products then expand through, and thereby drive, the high pressure and low pressure turbines 17, 19 before being exhausted through the nozzle 20 to provide some propulsive thrust. The high pressure turbine 17 drives the high pressure compressor 15 by a suitable interconnecting shaft 27. The fan 23 generally provides the majority of the propulsive thrust. The epicyclic gearbox 30 is a reduction gearbox. --> An exemplary arrangement for a geared fan gas turbine engine 10 is shown in Figure 2. The low pressure turbine 19 (see Figure 1) drives the shaft 26, which is coupled to a sun wheel, or sun gear, 28 of the epicyclic gear arrangement 30. Radially outwardly of the sun gear 28 and intermeshing therewith is a plurality of planet gears 32 that are coupled together by a planet carrier 34. The planet carrier 34 constrains the planet gears 32 to precess around the sun gear 28 in synchronicity whilst enabling each planet gear 32 to rotate about its own axis. The planet carrier 34 is coupled via linkages 36 to the fan 23 in order to drive its rotation about the engine axis 9. Radially outwardly of the planet gears 32 and intermeshing therewith is an annulus or ring gear 38 that is coupled, via linkages 40, to a stationary supporting structure 24. Note that the terms \"low pressure turbine\" and \"low pressure compressor\" as used herein may be taken to mean the lowest pressure turbine stages and lowest pressure compressor stages (i.e. not including the fan 23) respectively and/or the turbine and compressor stages that are connected together by the interconnecting shaft 26 with the lowest rotational speed in the engine (i.e. not including the gearbox output shaft that drives the fan 23). In some literature, the \"low pressure turbine\" and \"low pressure compressor\" referred to herein may alternatively be known as the \"intermediate pressure turbine\" and \"intermediate pressure compressor\". Where such alternative nomenclature is used, the fan 23 may be referred to as a first, or lowest pressure, compression stage. The epicyclic gearbox 30 is shown by way of example in greater detail in Figure 3. Each of the sun gear 28, planet gears 32 and ring gear 38 comprise teeth about their periphery to intermesh with the other gears. However, for clarity only exemplary portions of the teeth are illustrated in Figure 3. There are four planet gears 32 illustrated, although it will be apparent to the skilled reader that more or fewer planet gears 32 may be provided within the scope of the claimed invention. Practical applications of a planetary epicyclic gearbox 30 generally comprise at least three planet gears 32. The epicyclic gearbox 30 illustrated by way of example in Figures 2 and 3 is of the planetary type, in that the planet carrier 34 is coupled to an output shaft via linkages --> 36, with the ring gear 38 fixed. However, any other suitable type of epicyclic gearbox 30 may be used. By way of further example, the epicyclic gearbox 30 may be a star arrangement, in which the planet carrier 34 is held fixed, with the ring (or annulus) gear 38 allowed to rotate. In such an arrangement the fan 23 is driven by the ring gear 38. By way of further alternative example, the gearbox 30 may be a differential gearbox in which the ring gear 38 and the planet carrier 34 are both allowed to rotate. It will be appreciated that the arrangement shown in Figures 2 and 3 is by way of example only, and various alternatives are within the scope of the present disclosure. Purely by way of example, any suitable arrangement may be used for locating the gearbox 30 in the engine 10 and/or for connecting the gearbox 30 to the engine 10. By way of further example, the connections (such as the linkages 36, 40 in the Figure 2 example) between the gearbox 30 and other parts of the engine 10 (such as the input shaft 26, the output shaft and the fixed structure 24) may have any desired degree of stiffness or flexibility. By way of further example, any suitable arrangement of the bearings between rotating and stationary parts of the engine (for example between the input and output shafts from the gearbox and the fixed structures, such as the gearbox casing) may be used, and the disclosure is not limited to the exemplary arrangement of Figure 2. For example, where the gearbox 30 has a star arrangement (described above), the skilled person would readily understand that the arrangement of output and support linkages and bearing locations would typically be different to that shown by way of example in Figure 2. Accordingly, the present disclosure extends to a gas turbine engine having any arrangement of gearbox styles (for example star or planetary), support structures, input and output shaft arrangement, and bearing locations. Optionally, the gearbox may drive additional and/or alternative components (e.g. the intermediate pressure compressor and/or a booster compressor). Other gas turbine engines to which the present disclosure may be applied may have alternative configurations. For example, such engines may have an alternative number of compressors and/or turbines and/or an alternative number of --> interconnecting shafts. By way of further example, the gas turbine engine shown in Figure 1 has a split flow nozzle 20, 22 meaning that the flow through the bypass duct 22 has its own nozzle that is separate to and radially outside the core engine nozzle 20. However, this is not limiting, and any aspect of the present disclosure may also apply to engines in which the flow through the bypass duct 22 and the flow through the core 11 are mixed, or combined, before (or upstream of) a single nozzle, which may be referred to as a mixed flow nozzle. One or both nozzles (whether mixed or split flow) may have a fixed or variable area. Whilst the described example relates to a turbofan engine, the disclosure may apply, for example, to any type of gas turbine engine, such as an open rotor (in which the fan stage is not surrounded by a nacelle) or turboprop engine, for example. In some arrangements, the gas turbine engine 10 may not comprise a gearbox 30. The geometry of the gas turbine engine 10, and components thereof, is defined by a conventional axis system, comprising an axial direction (which is aligned with the rotational axis 9), a radial direction (in the bottom-to-top direction in Figure 1), and a circumferential direction (perpendicular to the page in the Figure 1 view). The axial, radial and circumferential directions are mutually perpendicular. Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of a conventional gas turbine engine fuel control system. The system is broadly divided into a fuel pumping unit (FPU) 60 and a fuel metering unit (FMU) 70. As shown in Figure 4, fuel from aircraft tanks 50 is pumped via engine tank pumps to the FPU 60. The FPU 60 typically comprises a low pressure (LP) pump 61 followed by a high pressure (HP) pump 62. The FPU 60 is typically mounted on the accessory gearbox (AGB) with the LP and HP pumps 61, 62 driven off the gearbox at a fixed ratio of engine shaft speed. The LP pump 61 pressurises the fuel before it passes to the downstream HP pump 62 via a fuel oil heat exchanger (FOHE) 63 and a main engine filter 64. The LP stage 61 is capable of handling the low inlet pressures and multiphase flow that will be presented to the fuel pump with failed airframe tank pumps; it is designed to generate sufficient pressure to ensure that, even with high inter-stage losses which will occur if the filter 64 and FOHE 63 are running on --> bypass, the HP gear stages 62 are not starved of flow. In other words the LP pump 61 helps prevent cavitation at the HP gear pump 62 inlet. The HP pump 62 is usually a fixed displacement pump, and so it delivers a fuel flow proportional to its speed of rotation. The pump 62 is sized to deliver a flow that exceeds the burner flow requirement of the engine at all operating conditions. Any surplus flow is spilled back to HP pump 62 inlet via the spill valve (SV) 71 in the FMU 70. Total HP pump 62 delivery flow passes from the FPU outlet 65 to the FMU inlet 72. On entering the FMU 70 the total flow from the HP pump 62 is split. The required burner flow passes through a fuel metering valve (FMV) 73, and any excess or surplus flow passing through the SV 71 back to HP pump 62 inlet, or to provide servo flow to actuation systems for engine variable geometry (such as Variable Stator Vane Actuators). Normal fuel metering is achieved via the valves of the FMU 70 - i.e. the FMV 73 and SV 71. FMV 73 is moved via servo flow from an associated servo-valve 74 to vary the opening of a flow metering port. The pressure drop across the metering port can be controlled to a nominally constant value via a pressure drop regulator (PDR) 75 and the SV 71. The PDR 75 senses any change in the FMV 73 pressure drop and adjusts a servo orifice to vary the servo flow to the SV 71 so that the SV 71 moves to restore the FMV 73 pressure drop by adjusting the amount of excess flow from the HP pump 62 which is spilt back to pump inlet. Thus, in normal operation, metered flow to the engine 10 is essentially a function of FMV 73 position. The FMV 73 position can be sensed by an appropriate position sensor and fed back to the electronic engine control (EEC) to facilitate so-called inner loop (i.e. fuel system level - see discussion below) control of FMV 73 position. Downstream of the FMV 73, flow passes through a pressure raising shut off valve (PRSOV) 76 before exiting the FMU 70 and passing to the engine burners via a delivery line and burner manifold. Typically, the PRSOV 76 comprises a piston moveable within a sleeve to control the opening of a flow port that connects the FMV --> 73 outlet line to the downstream burner delivery line. One side of the piston is exposed to downstream metering valve pressure and the other side has a spring load acting on it and also a reference pressure set by an associated shut off valve servo-valve (SOVSV - not shown). In normal operation, a low pressure supply is ported to the spring side of the PRSOV 76. The valve will only open against this pressure and the spring load, to allow flow to the burners, once a certain level of pressure is achieved on the upstream side, downstream of the FMV. In \\'shut off\\' mode, the SOVSV is energised to port HP fuel to the spring side of the PRSOV 76 so that the valve closes to provide a drip tight seal, closing off fuel flow to the engine 10. The conventional fuel control described above has limited capability for detecting or accommodating an un-commanded high engine thrust (UHT). This is explained by considering the typical fuel control loops associated with the FMU 70, which are shown schematically in Figure 5. FMV 73 position is controlled by an EEC 80. The EEC controls a slow outer control loop 81 and a fast inner control loop 82. The outer engine loop 81 sets a demand on an engine control parameter (for example, fan speed (N1) or engine pressure ratio (EPR), responding to changes set by the pilot\\'s throttle. The demanded value for the engine parameter is compared to an actual measured value and the resultant error signal is converted into a fuel flow demand by the EEC 80. The fuel flow demand is the input to the minor or inner control loop 82. This is converted into a FMV 73 demanded position which is compared to the actual FMV 73 position, as measured by an appropriate position sensor. FMV 73 position error is used to generate a current to drive the FMV servo-valve 74 which in turn drives the FMV 73 to its demanded position as previously described. As the FMV 73 moves to its demanded position, flow to the engine 10 changes and the engine 10 responds, the engine parameter under outer loop control 81 changing to meet the outer loop 81 demand. --> The inner loop 82 response (FMV 73 control) is much faster than the outer loop 81 response. This is because the latter relies on the engine 10 to respond before the engine control parameter can change. As a result, in the event of a failure internal to the FMU 70, causing an un-commanded increase in fuel flow to the burners, this system relies on a change in the engine control parameter to detect the potential UHT threat. That means UHT threat detection is slow. Further, the only subsequent action which can be taken is to shut down the engine via the SOVSV and PRSOV. That means options for UHT accommodation are limited. Engine shut down is a limited option and is only really applicable on the ground. In-flight (and in some cases on the ground as well), slow detection of a UHT event on one engine can lead to the aircraft experiencing gross asymmetric thrust. With limited aircraft rudder authority/response this can be hazardous, particularly at low altitude conditions such as approach to a runway. Once detected, shut down of an engine 10 experiencing UHT can itself lead to the aircraft experiencing gross asymmetric thrust, particularly if the aircraft rudder has been adjusted in an attempt to compensate for the UHT - sudden shut down of the engine can result in asymmetric thrust caused by a combination of having one functional engine and an incorrectly positioned rudder. Figure 6 presents a UHT protection system. In this system, normal fuel metering is achieved via the valves of the FMU 70. As in Figure 4, FMV 73 of Figure 5 is moved via servo flow from an associated servo-valve 74 to vary the opening of a flow metering port. The pressure drop across the metering port is controlled to a nominally constant value via the PDR 75 and the SV 71. The PDR 75 senses any change in the FMV 73 pressure drop and adjusts a servo orifice to vary the servo flow to the SV 71. This causes the SV 71 to move to restore the FMV 73 pressure drop by adjusting the amount of excess flow from the HP pump 62 that is spilt back to pump inlet. Thus, in normal operation, metered flow --> to the engine 10 is essentially a function of FMV 73 position. That position is sensed by an appropriate position sensor and fed back to the EEC 80 to facilitate inner loop 82 (i.e. fuel system level) control of FMV 73 position. In the event of a FMV 73 fault (e.g. upward runaway of the FMV 73 or a jammed FMV 73), an overthrust threat is detected via the engine control loop (outer loop 81) which senses a change in an engine parameter. The EEC 80 then acts to energise a thrust control malfunction (TCM) servo-valve 77 which moves to vent the SV 71 servo pressure back to HP pump 62 inlet pressure (LP). This opens the SV 71 to increase spill flow and simultaneously reduces flow through the FMV 73 to the burners. Thus the level of overselling /overthrust is limited. Similarly, in the event of an overthrust threat caused by a jammed SV 71 (too far closed), this can be sensed by the outer control loop and accommodated by the EEC 80 closing the FMV 73. In both of the above scenarios, the main drawback is the slow speed of response. The slow outer control loop 81 has to wait for a change in a key engine parameter to first detect and then accommodate a potential UHT threat. The measured engine parameter provides the feedback signal to the EEC 80 in TCM control mode. Consequently, an appreciable increase in thrust can occur before the burner flow is pulled back. There are other ways of achieving control to avoid UHT. Many of these suffer from the same issue, their response to an upward runaway of the FMV or a jammed FMV/SV or an incorrect/lost FMV position signal being slow because of their reliance on the slow outer engine control loop 81. Thus, the systems described above are limited in their ability to meet UHT detection and accommodation requirements on modern engines. Detection via the outer loop 81 is slow (the engine 10 can reach an unacceptable level of overthrust before action is taken) and accommodation by shutting down the engine 10 can exacerbate the UHT problem. --> Therefore, it is preferable to have a system capable of rapidly detecting a UHT threat and, before it manifests to any significant extent at engine level, that is subsequently able to maintain control the fuel flow to the engine, thereby controlling engine thrust. This can be achieved by providing a direct or inferred measurement of burner flow which can be used by the fast inner loop 82, as set out below. Preferably, any measurement device used to provide that measurement should be sufficiently responsive so as to not compromise the dynamic capability of the loop to control burner flow. In other words, the dynamic capability of the flow measurement device is preferably faster than that of the engine to provide a benefit in detection speed. Figure 7 shows an arrangement where a flow sensing device 78 is located in the main flow line to the burners. In general, the device 78 can be downstream of the FMV 73 in the FMU 70 (as shown) or upstream of the FMV 73 in the FMU 70 or downstream of the FMU 70 in a separate body. In Figure 7, the flow measuring device 78 is shown as a flow sensing valve (FSV) 78. The FSV 78 in Figure 7 incorporates a position sensor 79. However, the FSV 78 can take several different forms as long as it provides a measure of flow. Possible options for the FSV 78 include:a flowmeter e.g. a turbine flow meter, provided it is sufficiently responsive;an orifice plate arrangement, using an orifice of known size with a pressure drop sensor across it, from which flow can be computed from the area of the orifice and the pressure drop across it;a single stage flow sensing valve; anda two stage flow sensing valve. A single stage flow sensing valve can comprise a piston in a sleeve with a spring at one end of the piston. Inlet fuel flow can be fed into the non-spring end of the valve and pass by a metering edge on the piston through a flow profile cut into the sleeve. Thus, the non-spring end of the piston is exposed to high inlet pressure while the spring chamber is flooded, with lower pressure from downstream of the profile. As flow increases, the piston moves to open the exposed area of the profile. A position --> sensor is used to detect piston position, the measured position being a measure of flow passing through the flow profile. A two stage flow sensing valve can be considered as a two stage version of the single stage valve. A first stage piston can sense the pressure drop across a flow profile cut into a second stage sleeve and balances it against a first stage spring load. The first stage piston pilots a second stage piston which moves to vary the flow area of the flow profile. High upstream pressure acts at the flowing end of the second stage piston whilst the other end is exposed to a secondary spring load and servo pressure. An orifice potentiometer, formed by a fixed first orifice and a second orifice variable with position of the pilot stage piston, can take fuel pressure from upstream of the FSV, and returns flow to downstream of the FSV. The intermediate servo pressure between the two restrictions can act at the spring end of the second stage piston. When flow through the flow profile changes, the pressure drop across it changes. This is sensed by the first stage piston which moves to vary the restriction of the variable orifice. This disturbs the servo flow balance across the potentiometer arrangement such that there is a net flow into/out of the second stage servo chamber. This displaces the second stage piston to vary the flow profile area until the profile pressure drop is restored. In other words, the first stage senses and maintains a nominally constant pressure drop across the flow profile by piloting the second stage piston. As flow increases, the second stage piston moves to open the flow area of the profile so that piston position, measured by an appropriate position sensor is a measure of flow. A two stage FSV 78 might have a bandwidth of around 4 Hz. A single stage FSV 78 bandwidth can be significantly higher, for example greater than 10 Hz. In general a flow sensor 78 for use in the invention preferably has a bandwidth of more than 0.5 Hz, more preferably more than 0.75 Hz, still more preferably more than 1 Hz, still more preferably more than 2 Hz, and still more preferably greater than or equal to 4 Hz. In any case, whatever form of flow sensing device 78 is used, it plays no role in setting the metered flow to the engine in normal conditions. It is simply a \"passive\" device, monitoring the metered flow which is typically set by the FMV 73. That is, --> although the device may include moving parts (as described in options above) it is \"passive\" in the sense of only reacting to the flow and pressure conditions around it, and not being directly controlled by a signal from the EEC 80. A FMV servo-valve 74 can provide servo flow to either end of the FMV 73. The FMV 73 can comprise a piston moveable in a sleeve with a metering edge to vary the opening of a metering profile cut into its sleeve. Varying the input current to the FMV servo-valve 74 varies the servo flow to the FMV 73 so that FMV 73 moves to change the area of the metering profile exposed to fuel flow. The pressure drop across the metering port can be controlled to a nominally constant value by the PDR 75 and SV 71, as has been discussed in connection with previous figures. That is, the PDR 75 can sense the FMV 73 pressure drop and adjusts a servo orifice to vary the servo flow to the SV 71, so that the SV 71 moves to adjust the amount of excess flow from the HP pump 62 which is spilt back to the pump inlet. Thus, in normal operation, metered flow to the engine 10 is essentially a function of FMV 73 position, the latter being sensed by an appropriate position sensor and fed back to the EEC 80 to facilitate inner loop 82 control of FMV 73 position. By directly measuring the metered flow, the FSV 78 provides an accurate and rapid means of detecting any fault where the actual metered flow significantly exceeds the demanded flow, for example. A threshold amount between the actual flow and the demanded flow may be set, to trigger a control response. In other words, the flow measurement feedback signal can be used by the EEC 80 to identify a potential UHT threat. If the threshold difference is passed, this can be detected by the fast EEC inner loop control 82, without relying on the slow outer engine control loop 81 to detect a change in an engine parameter. The threshold difference between the actual flow and the demanded flow amount may be a negative amount or a positive amount and may vary with engine condition including during engine transients. The threshold may be set at some absolute difference or percentage amount difference compared to the determined flow. A high measured flow, in comparison to the demanded flow, can be indicative of a loss of fuel flow control. That may be caused by an upward runaway/jamming of the FMV 73 (i.e. a loss of position control that tends to open the FMV 73 and increase --> burner flow) or downward failure/jamming of the SV 71 (i.e. closure of the SV 71 spill ports, resulting in an increase in burner flow). FMV 73 position faults may be caused by a failure of the FMU 70 mechanical valves or by an EEC 80 drive circuit fault. Upon detection of a high burner flow, in comparison to the demanded flow, the EEC 80 can switch into TCM fuel control mode. The EEC 80 may attempt to close the FMV 73 as the fault may be due to the SV 71 being in too closed a position (low spill flow, high burner flow). Alternatively, if flow does not decrease as a result of attempting to close the FMV 73 (in this case, the cause of the high burner flow is a loss of control of the FMV 73), the TCM servo-valve can be energised to vent SV 71 servo pressure back to a low pressure source (typically HP pump 62 inlet pressure) so that the SV 71 opens to increase spill flow, thereby reducing/limiting the burner flow. In either case, the EEC 80 can maintain control of the metered flow either by modulating the FMV (in the case of as spill valve failure) or by modulating the spill valve (in the case of an FMV failure) . As such, the level of overfuelling/ overthrust is limited and closed loop control is achieved using the fast inner control loop 82 via the EEC 80, the FSV 78 providing a flow feedback signal. This means there is no reliance on the slower outer/engine control loop 81 to provide a feedback signal for flow control. That is, burner flow continues to be controlled by the inner loop with the outer loop not having TCM related control components in its algorithms. In other words, the outer loop will continue to try to control according to normal operation, so will still be required for engine control, but UHT can be controlled by the inner loop. In summary, closed inner loop control can be achieved for any fault where the burner flow is significantly higher than demand. The fault may be caused by, amongst others: FMV 73 upward failure, position known or unknown; FMV 73 being jammed; incorrect FMV 73 position measurement; SV 71 downward failure; or SV being jammed too far closed. In a non-UHT scenario, the scheme also offers the potential to partially accommodate any jamming of the FMV 73 or SV 71. Should the FMV 73 jam, closed loop flow control can be achieved by modulating the SV 71 via the TCM servo-valve --> 77, using the FSV 78 for inner loop flow feedback. Here, the maximum achievable burner flow may be limited by a pump pressure relief valve (PPRV - not shown). The PPRV will open to spill pump delivery flow back to pump inlet should the increase in flow through the FMV 73 (as the SV 71 closes) raise the system pressure to a level above the PPRV cracking point. Similarly, should the SV 71 jam, closed loop control can be achieved by modulating the FMV 73 via its servo-valve 74, again using the FSV 78 for flow feedback. In this case, the maximum achievable flow may be limited at the maximum FMV 73 opening for a given position of the failed SV 71. Figure 8 shows an alternative arrangement in which the FSV 78 is located in the spill return line to monitor spill flow. In this arrangement, the EEC 80 can compute burner flow from pump speed and spill flow measurement, approximating pump and FMU leakage from burner flow demand, pump speed and combustion chamber pressure measurements. Alternatively, the system can be run at a condition where the burner flow is zero (e.g. the normal scenario during engine spool-up prior to commencing delivery of burner flow to the engine for light-up), to compute combined leakage of the pump 62, FMU 70 and any other component between pump outlet and inlet pressure, for use in later pump health monitoring. In any case, a burner flow indicative of the health of the pump 62 is given by: Burner Flow=Net pump flow−Spill Flow−FMU&amp;other componentleakage Comparing demanded flow to calculated burner flow, the EEC 80 can detect a \\'high\\' flow fault and limit it through fast inner loop control of the FMV 73 or SV 71 control as described above. Compared to the Figure 7 arrangement, the Figure 8 arrangement may have some drawbacks in certain scenarios. It may be less accurate because it does not directly measure the burner flow, relying instead on a calculated approximation. Similarly, the inner loop 82 response may be slower, as burner flow has to be calculated from a number of other signals. However, the benefit of this arrangement is that the FSV 78 can be used for direct measurement of the spill flow. This can provide a direct measurement of pump health; as the pump wears, spill flow at any given condition will decrease. --> Figures 9 and 10 relate to another alternative arrangement that could be employed if there are difficulties associated with installation of the FMU 70 on the engine 10. This might occur, for example, if the additional UHT protection functionality within the FMU cannot be accommodated in the space available. An additional TCM servo-valve 77 and FSV 73 downstream of the metering valve could cause such issues in some engines. In any case, the relative positions of the burner manifold supplying fuel the engine 10 burners, the FMU 70 and manifold drains tank are important and can impose installation constraints. As mentioned above, the position of the FSV 73 can vary. As such, it can be downstream of the PRSOV 76, and the functionality could be integrated into any flow throttle by adding a position sensor. An example of such an arrangement is a use in a flow splitter valve, used for distributing fuel between manifolds. A schematic view of such a system is shown in Figure 9, in which it can be seen that between FMU 70 and the splitter and drain valve unit 100, there may also be a flowmeter and HP filter 90. This flowmeter is of the highly accurate type for measuring the total fuel supplied to the engine for data gathering purposes. However, technologies suitable for the engine environment, and that can provide sufficient accuracy for this flowmeter, typically cannot also provide sufficiently high bandwidth for fuel metering. For example, a two stage FSV 78 might have a bandwidth of around 4 Hz. A single stage FSV 78 bandwidth can be significantly higher, for example greater than 10 Hz. A conventional engine flow meter bandwidth is around 0.5 Hz. Further, as shown in Figure 10, a position sensor 179 can be added to the splitter/drain valve 100 so that it can also be used as a flow sensing device in an analogous manner to the FSV 78 in Figures 7 and 8. The piston 101 senses upstream pressure and upper manifold pressure (i.e. downstream valve pressure, the same as lower manifold), so piston 101 position can be used to infer a measure of burner flow, operating as a fast acting flow sensing device downstream of the FMV 73 that can be used for control in an analogous manner to the FSV 78 of Figure --> 7. This also further simplifies size reduction of the FMU 70 as the FSV 78 of the other arrangements can be omitted because the functionality of the splitter/drain valve 100 is extended to provide a flow sensing function instead. However, the arrangements of Figure 7 or Figure 8 may be preferable if the splitter &amp; drain unit 100 is located in a hot region, e.g. close to the burner ring, which may not be suitable conditions for the position sensor 79 and associated wiring. In summary, the various arrangements discussed above facilitate rapid detection and accommodation of a higher than demanded fuel flow, thereby minimising the level of any engine overthrust. By measuring the metered flow, detection of a fault and UHT threat is fast. Unlike other systems, such detection does not rely on the slow outer engine control loop to detect a change in an engine parameter. Subsequent EEC control of flow can also be via a fast inner loop using measured flow feedback rather than relying on an engine parameter fed back via the slow outer loop. These arrangements are reliable and accurate because the metered flow measurement is direct (i.e. based on a measured flow) and is not inferred from other parameter measurements. It will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments above-described and various modifications and improvements can be made without departing from the concepts described herein. Except where mutually exclusive, any of the features may be employed separately or in combination with any other features and the disclosure extends to and includes all combinations and subcombinations of one or more features described herein.'}]"
